We chose EOD because central to our IT strategy is running all business apps, including email, either in a hosted environment or in the Cloud. SalesForce and Arena (a cloud-based PLM application) were already in place when we implemented EOD. The person responsible for Sales Ops at the time ended up spending a large percentage of her time manually updating SFDC in an attempt to keep it in synch with EOD. This situation was clearly not scalable, so our interest in Expandable's Integration offering dates from about mid-2009. The most important piece of the Integration for us was the ability to convert SFDC Opportunities into Expandable SOs, so we patiently waited for Expandable to complete development of that module before implementing in late 2012. <br/><br/>Implementing Integration was a key part of a larger project that included not only EOD and SFDC, but also interfaces with our proprietary Network Operating System called ChargePoint. As it turns out, we were an early adopter of the whole Integration suite, and the first to implement the Opp to SO conversion module. There were some hiccups in the implementation, as one might expect from being first, but Expandable's Product Manager for Integration was very attentive and provided great support throughout the project.<br/><br/>We've been running Integration in production since mid-December 2012 and are very happy with the results. We started out launching each module of Integration on demand, just so we could track the results of each process in a controlled fashion. Today we are running all of the modules on a scheduled and simply monitoring for reports of any errors. This is saving an enormous amount of time for Sales Ops, both in keeping EOD and SFDC in synch and in streamlining the creation of SOs. Plus, having eliminated manual updates, data integrity vastly improved."}]

An added value of this method is the gamification of our ticket queue. Team members feel challenged to get rid of all of those solid dots.

Yes. TR wants to learn and try to rollout really beneficial changes inspired by one org to the whole user base. It is a progressive model of reinvention for the greater good.<br/>6. Do you need to know how to conduct UAT yourself? Yes. What works for basic testing probably won't trigger errors for your uses so your team needs to have someone with an understanding of dynamic use case scenarios.<br/>7. Will everything be taken literally and not applied to context? Yes. Be very careful how you word things - expect lots of repetition and many setup/confirmation/followup calls.

One of our very clear questions to solution providers was "for an organisation comparable with us, what is the average cost of implementation and customisation using your software?". The answers didn’t really surprise us as most provided the software at a cheap start-up cost BUT most were charging many, many thousands to customise and implement. You can do most of this yourself, if you have the time or a software implementation background. We didn’t have the time to customised and implement, we\'re recruiters, not software implementers. <br/><br/>A competitor of mine confirmed what we had been thinking. Over lunch one day he informed me that he had chosen one of the companies we were considering (but dropped because of implementation costs). He was a similar sized organisation (under 15) and his implementation costs were in excess of $100,000 and rising. He said he was locked in and felt trapped by his choice. <br/><br/>TargetRecruit is a good solid product, not unlike many of the others BUT the implementation, support, service and their desire to have you up and running at minimal cost and stress is where they clearly win over all the others.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000007D9ndEAC', 'reviewer_id': '00530000004cmhXAAQ', 'reviewer_name': 'Mats Goldberg', 'rating_stars': '40', 'review_date': 'Aug 02, 2011 at 10:05 AM', 'review_title': 'Super service!', 'review_description': 'I have found the TargetRecruit application to fully fullfill our needs as a executive search company.

I then saw another successful Kenandy implementation across our larger organization, while replacing a much older and customized ERP solution, with a high cost of ownership. <br/><br/>I would recommend Kenandy to organizations seeking to execute their company strategies through enabling business capabilities and agile business processes, while realizing the benefits of operating in the cloud and on the Salesforce platform. Through partnership with Kenandy, I’ve seen first-hand the implementation of business processes that took years to develop in the legacy world, in a number of months. End users have told me that information is very easily accessible and the ease of navigation and reporting empowers them to make better and faster business decisions. <br/><br/>Supporting the object configuration and data environment is very manageable. The support staff at Kenandy are very bright individuals and will work with you to ensure successful results.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000JDtznEAD', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000CTEkGAAX', 'reviewer_name': 'Dan Raven', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Dec 23, 2015 at 5:23 PM', 'review_title': 'ERP Project Management Consultant', 'review_description': 'I have found Kenandy to be the most full-featured ERP on the Salesforce platform.

My prior experience was that of an SAP consultant and I find Kenandy much easier to work with. The fact that it is native to the Salesforce platform means that it can easily work with other applications on the App Exchange. I have seen it working for large customer with EDI and Tibco integrations and smaller customers with very few interfaces. It is very flexible and the Kenandy team is great to work with!

Out team regularly points to all of the failed or late implementations that they\'ve worked on in the past. We have many "war" stories and "nightmares" associated with implementations to share.........and I can tell you we\'ve not added to that very long of issue because we are dealing with the "right" solution.

There is nothing in the marketplace today that would have allowed us to achieve our goals while supporting our growth needs all in one. As an additional note, I had recommended Kenandy to another local company of similar profile and they decided to go with another.

Focusing on customer satisfaction has been a key ingredient to our success and depends a great deal on our ability to fulfill the customer’s needs in a timely manner. We build our systems to order and are usually able to ship on the same day we receive the order. Almost all of our products are shipped within 24 hours of the order. To achieve this objective of rapid shipment, on increasing sales, we need to have accurate data that is easy to interpret on a system used by diverse personnel ranging from management, sales, marketing, production and shipping. <br/><br/>We were looking at creating custom applications in Salesforce to manage Order Fulfillment. We were using Mail Merge and email templates for Quotes, Sales Orders, Shipping Instructions, Pack List and RMAs. Mail Merge and email templates, while useful were a bit cumbersome because we have a mix of Mac and PC computers and there are a lot of extra steps required for the Mac users because none of the automation Salesforce built into Outlook could be used by our Sales personnel.<br/><br/>The Glovia system eliminates all the extra steps by having buttons that turn Opportunities into Quotes, Quotes into Sales Orders and Sales Orders into shipping orders and documentation. At each stage there is a button to simply email the pdf form. Initially we took the unnecessary step of working in a Sandbox. Glovia integrates over the top of the existing Salesforce framework without stepping all over our current customizations. This means that development can be done on the production environment and exposed when you are ready to switch over.<br/><br/>Our next steps will be to customize the documents, link the data to Quickbooks and our Order Fulfillment house’s database so we can view our entire sales to fulfillment process and inventory in a singular place and reduce the time spent managing inventory in Quickbook’s limited GUI.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000000xVEuEAM', 'reviewer_id': '00530000001sAZVAA2', 'reviewer_name': 'Seth Klugman', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Mar 18, 2009 at 4:16 PM', 'review_title': 'Excellent Product', 'review_description': "This product very nicely integrates into Salesforce and has all the necessary functionality to effectively manage inventory.

GigaOM has been quick to cite work media and internal collaboration tools targeted at enterprises as a business sector ripe for change, and I agree. It's time technology warmed up the sales process. <br/><br/>Now, I will say it's still early for Radius. They're database of SMB's needs to grow and diversify, and they need to add more filters (like searching and dissecting a territory by area code), But, the foundation for success is there. As Radius grows, I'd like to see them challenge the mundane but efficient design of Salesforce centralizing my prospecting and sales cycle data (everything in one system, right now, I feel like I still need salesforce). Humanizing the sales process from the start is crucial. It's something I try to do on my own when I prospect using the company websites, blogs, and Linkedin.

The data sync is seamless. The most valuable and important feature to us is the ability to segment subscriber lists based on Salesforce fields. We have created subscribers lists in a couple of clicks based on data such gender, birthdates, graduates, etc that is already in Salesforce. <br/><br/>There's a couple of features of the software that may not be obvious but absolutely must be pointed out. By segmenting subscriber lists, you will save money on your Campaign Monitor subscription as you only need to have a subscriber on 1 list rather than multiple.

We are currently using barcoding in our inventory as well as our receiving functionality and have built functionality around each for practical list views which sort to what we need to print out for locations, product barcodes as we receive them, and custom barcoding needs. More important than our use and my review of this particular product is my review of the company itself. We utilize a SalesForce native platform accounting package called Accounting Seed and many custom objects and functions in our organization. Gimbal Logic, their owner, and their development team are very professional and seem to be able to handle any custom functionality design we can think of to make our processes as automatic as possible. This relates to both this 3rd party package and any native SF features beyond our internal design capabilities. For this reason I highly recommend Gimbal Logic as a platform partner to reach out to for any custom development needs. They listen very clearly to any requests, before beginning any development they fully "think out" the design model including often questions or additional features which may not have been originally perceived. In the end they can offer modular solutions catered to you at a reasonable design price point. We have and will continue to use them extensively in the future. I highly recommend this company. If you have any challenges or requests within your SalesForce Org, I recommend reaching out to them, you will be happy with the results. -David Testator'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000Ja3MyUAJ', 'reviewer_id': '0053A00000DEni2QAD', 'reviewer_name': 'Ted Salek', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Oct 11, 2017 at 4:36 PM', 'review_title': 'Warehouse Management Solution', 'review_description': 'Our organization has a seasonal warehouse where members come in typically 2 times a year.

Luckily SF is somewhat intuitive in use (hence 3 stars, otherwise it would be 2), just not in set-up, or maybe that\'s JS. When I asked for help I was sent to SF help trainings, and it turns out SF license we bought with JS didn\'t include much and was all SF terminology. To this day I\'m still trying to figure out what SF terms are translated to in JS, find that my managers don\'t have views or accesses to reports we were promised, etc. Help is "go to create; objects and there you\'ll find the thing you want to customize". I still have different picklists that come up for the Reject option depending on what tab I\'m in, as they don\'t all sync up, and there are several objects/labels that don\'t sync, despite changing picklists in multiple objects and sections. Read carefully what your contract does and does not include on help, implementation and training, as JS actually does not have any training available, they just send you to SF generic training.

IPfolio offers workflows to automate data entry and to reduce errors. Once all is set up, I spend less time on data entry and tracking. IPfolio customer support impresses even more. Tyler Dunk at IPfolio has been helping me with operation, configuration, and customization of IPfolio installation. Tyler is friendly, personable, and offers a wealth of information (there is not a single issue that he was not able to address). What impresses me even more is Tyler’s willingness to go above and beyond and this makes me a believer in IPfolio. In short, IPfolio sets a new standard for product design, performance, and customer service.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JpvgkUAB', 'reviewer_id': '0053A00000DE4WHQA1', 'reviewer_name': 'Alexander Grundmeier', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Feb 01, 2017 at 5:30 AM', 'review_title': 'Great software, greater support', 'review_description': 'Really powerful and highly flexible IP management software that can be adapted to your own personal needs.

I\'ve been watching IPFolio\'s growth with interest (in the enhanced product features offered), but with some trepidation (can they continue to grow and maintain the same world class, personal service to which I\'ve become accustomed?)<br/><br/>The answer is an unequivocal "Yes!".

Here, genius-at-large Kevin Nugent has done an extraordinary job of both establishing that base-level functionality as well as being available often on very short notice to assist in on-the-job training for me. The number one biggest challenge, however, has been the integration of years worth of parallel data that existed at our outside patent counsel's firm. In this case, Kevin teamed with Heather Fleener to migrate that data into IPfolio then work thru a very tedious data-compare. Heather's IPfolio expertise combined with very strong IP operational experience has ensured total success with very little downtime for me.

This product is a dream for our in-house patent group, with its simplified data input, robust searching and report generation, batch editing, large-scale imports, all of which add up to increased productivity for the whole team.

In addition we wanted the software to (1) Create new accounts in SAGE from Salesforce and (2) Create new Sales Orders in SAGE from Quotes in Salesforce.<br/><br/>Through the first 18 months of this implementation (through June 2018), the sync stopped working continually. Support would/could not tell me why. I tried to elevate my own case (no response from my sales rep). In January 2018, I was assigned a new account manager to help resolve my issues, but nothing improved. So in June, I posted my frustration here on the app exchange. I was promptly contacted by the management team at Commercient. They explained that they would fix my issues, and they did. The sync is currently functioning properly.<br/><br/>Pros: When functioning, the software will bring in everything you have in the SAGE tables, and sync periodically (X times per day) to managed custom objects. This unlocks a lot of potential through the Salesforce reporting, automation and alert functionality. We have invested a lot of time in this middleware, so I am hoping it will run smoothly<br/><br/>Cons: Support is slow to resolve issues. My support tickets have taken 1-2 weeks on average to resolve (sample size 20 tickets). Each time we have a ticket open, someone must make telecon calls with support so that they can manipulate the on premise software. This can be time-consuming.<br/><br/>The system provides no alert when it stops syncing, so you must monitor it. Any change to SAGE install or to the SAGE tables syncing can cause it to stop syncing.<br/><br/>Lastly, the software is more expensive than we anticipated. We were surprised that our rates jumped after the first year (we thought we had signed a 3 year contract). A per user model can make this much more expensive than the competitors if you grow.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JuuD9UAJ', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000CWAWxAAP', 'reviewer_name': 'David Wieder', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Oct 16, 2017 at 2:11 PM', 'review_title': "Couldn't be Happier!!", 'review_description': "Commercient has delivered exactly what we needed - all of our Sage data synced to Salesforce.

The Act-On guys are just introducing these capabilities, so they don't really understand it themselves yet... and they're charging an arm and a leg for it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed working with Andy, we were able to get up and running in less than an hour, and the Bizible team has been supportive throughout testing and implementation.

We searched and reviewed several different software providers, after a lengthy search we decided on Ascent. <br/><br/>Ascent was exactly what we were looking for, not only for the capabilities of the software, but also for the implementation team. In my experience, no matter how great the software is, if the implementation isn't done properly it can lead to a lot of headaches, as this type of software touches nearly every part of the business.<br/><br/>We decided to go with Ascent ERP for the operations side of the business and Financial Force for the accounting side. Our sales and marketing team was already utilizing Sales Force as their CRM platform, so we searched for a solution that would plug into SF, or better yet would run on SF. The software we looked at that ran outside of the SF platform required a connector software to push and pull the data in and out of SF. After speaking to several companies that utilized a system outside of the SF platform, we quickly realized that there was quite a bit of expense to purchase and maintain the connector software, not to mention that data integrity seemed to be less than ideal. Having Ascent run on SF greatly reduced our cost and implementation timeline as the Ascent implementation team handled the Financial Force implementation as well. It was great having one point of contact as the two pieces of software need to work hand in hand seamlessly. <br/><br/>I can't speak highly enough of the implementation team assigned to us, Tom and Chase.

It allows hands off approaches such as drop ship options to manual assignments of equipment to accounts. While we are a small company, we have gone from housing equipment in several different states to managing them all within the same building. All the while Ascent has helped us to easily manage and track our inventory. <br/><br/>Two things I was most surprised about working with Ascent was 1) their willingness to customize Ascent for our specific company's needs; and 2) their high level of support. Being a start up we have dealt with a large volume of traffic of equipment with very few hands to manually process, tag, and organize them. The Ascent team created a system specifically for us that allows us to translate product shipment serial numbers directly into Ascent/SF with a scan gun. This has saved us days and weeks of man hours, not to mention increase accuracy compared with manual entry. With regard to support, they have made themselves readily available with multiple in house visits for training as well as after hours technical support when we have run into issues with our other SF systems. <br/><br/>In addition to easing the fiduciary responsibility of tracking equipment, having the Ascent's inventory tracking system has greatly facilitated the responsiveness of our technical services (customer support) when on call with customers. In real time they are able to see exactly which model, make, and serial number the accounts/contacts have in their possession, can easily determine the history of the product, and if needed, are able to (all based from the same Account or Case object) Drop Ship a new item to them. It has helped us accelerate the amount of time need to both determine the true needs of the customer and ultimately to close a case."}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000001qrwlEAA', 'reviewer_id': '00530000003RmCcAAK', 'reviewer_name': 'Christine Morgan', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Aug 13, 2010 at 8:55 AM', 'review_title': 'Ascent - An inexpensive solution for a personalised inventory management system', 'review_description': "This is a great Management Information System!

Sales staff have used salesforce as their CRM package for the last 3 years. The ability to integrate sales and operations information through an inventory management application became a necessity as the company expanded and set up an office in the USA. Ascent was the only suitable application available to integrate with Salesforce. We started the Ascent implementation in August 2008.<br/><br/>As a small company we found the data transfer &amp; integration to be tedious. However, no matter what software you try to implement, the same is true. The support offered by Precisio was very good, conference calls &amp; Go to Meeting services were used to train / debug and fix issues. SensL were the first non-US company to implement the software, thus there were some teething issues. The Precisio staff quickly implemented many of the requests which would enhance the software, examples of this include enabling multiple currencies &amp; allowing new lots to be created from the receive PO page. For a small to medium size company, salesforce and ascent is probably more suitable &amp; less complicated to implement rather than more rigid applications such as SAP.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the system enhancement requiring Dreamforce, which has been promised has been continuously delayed. The current application requires a lot of navigation between tabs/screens to input or retrieve data. Also, ascent generates pre-defined documents such as pack slips etc, but Mail merge tool is not adequately supported. A pet hate is the flashing Ascent logo which is very distracting.<br/><br/>I have found the staff at Precisio to be very professional, helpful and responsive to our needs.

A manager then has a separate view where they review the rep submissions for the week, and either approve or disapprove the request. For approved ones, the manager checks a box visible in the view, to indicate these Opportunities are manager reviewed &amp; approved.

My users and I were getting frustrated with built in Salesforce functionality, working with a combination of Reports and Views. Reports can't be edited, and Views can only show fields from one object. It's also cumbersome to edit the data in Views, and annoying to change their filter criteria as well. ActionGrid stepped in to save the day. With ActionGrid, you can show data from any related object right next to the object you're looking at. It's super easy to edit a field. There's batch edit too, and lots of cool features. For example, you can export straight from a grid to Excel. No need to go create a report that looks like the view. You can fiter and unfilter, sort and sort again, add columns and remove them, all on the fly.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things is that Grids can be embedded almost anywhere. You can put them on their own tabs, with subtabs so for things you need to access together. You can also put them on any page view. For example, on my Campaign page layout, I have a grid that shows me all the Opportunities that fall in that campaign, with subtabs for different Opportunity Stages. <br/><br/>Their Customer Support is second to none. They are always happy to jump on a call / gotomeeting and figure out exactly how to do what I need.<br/><br/>They are also always coming out with new features, and are very receptive to suggestions. <br/><br/>All in all, I'm very happy with ActionGrid!"}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JUkuqUAD', 'reviewer_id': '0053A00000CMZ5DQAX', 'reviewer_name': 'Johana Palomino', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'May 19, 2016 at 12:16 PM', 'review_title': 'Action Grid - Efficient and easy to use!!', 'review_description': 'Our department has greatly benefited from Action Grid!

Those spreadsheets take time, lots of coordination and upkeep to maintain accurate records. We were looking for a tool to help us manage our data more from within our CRM and less through Excel. After much searching the app exchange, we found ActionGrid . . . and I am glad we did.<br/><br/>It was a bit confusing at first if you are not use to coding, but the AG team reached out to see if we needed help executing our installation. It actually came at the right time because during our trial, we had just instituted a referendum to get off the spreadsheets. I scheduled a time with the AG team and within half an hour of them walking us through the system, we were up and going. I had received enough guidance, that setting up new screens and buttons was something i could do on my own.<br/><br/>Now, we have three separate teams using the tables / grids AG offers us to help process data in bulk and have that data hit our CRM live. Our processing time is starting to speed up more and little by little we are getting off of the spreadsheets.<br/><br/>After seeing what AG could do for us, I have had a few other items I needed help with and with a couple of simple conversations, the AG team came up with workable solutions.<br/><br/>So, not only is the product solid and flexible, the customer support / technical team has been superb and responsive.<br/><br/>If you have lots of data manipulation needs that aren't native to Salesforce or you need a simpler way to look at your data, Action Grid is worth your time to investigate. It has made our Salesforce application much more powerful and i can see the demise of our spreadsheets in the near future.<br/><br/>Thanks, ActionGrid<br/><br/>(this was not a paid endorsement . . . I am an actual user!)<br/>:-)"}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JNm5hUAD', 'reviewer_id': '0053A00000CmrfuQAB', 'reviewer_name': 'Sarah Cassidy', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Apr 18, 2016 at 4:56 PM', 'review_title': 'Quick Clarity', 'review_description': 'Although I am a relatively new user of Action Grid, I have already experienced the difference.

The custom actions are a HUGE distinguishing feature between ActionGrid and other competitors.

For example, an opportunity grid with tabs that show open : won : lost : renewals related to that account. No developer needed. <br/>- Content library - mass archive content, mass update tags, custom fields, etc.<br/><br/>Reports that would normally require exporting and VLOOKUPS can be done with grids. For example: make a grid of sold products to see who has purchased X. This gives you a bunch of rows with X. Use ActionGrid to Drill Up to the unique list of opportunities then Drill Up to the unique list of accounts. From the accounts, you could Drill Down to the contacts. Now you have a list of customer references for your prospects looking to buy X.<br/><br/>Our users are very happy and ActionGrid has made me look like the hero.

You can also edit childs of those child records, or other related records all from one small grid in the page layout using 'Reading Panes'.<br/><br/>-Create quick data management views and shortcuts to edit revenue forecasts, sales stages, and other important fields for an entire pipeline - all at once!

Transfer owners, update internal team contacts, modify contact roles, modify address information on all contacts for a company move, and more! <br/><br/>-Use conditional formatting within views to point out specific records or areas: we use conditional formatting on 'Last Activity' on all of our contacts to highlight contacts that should be followed up with. <br/><br/>-Build, modify, and export reports on the fly! You can interact with any report as an ActionGrid and export as soon as you've made your changes, all in one screen. <br/><br/>-All fields supported: picklists, multi-picklists, long text, etc.!<br/><br/>All around 100% A+.

The only lightning feature available is to provide the option for your grid to have a "Lightning Look", but you cannot actually setup buttons to use the grid with various objects. <br/><br/>The Browse feature is no longer supported and that function was used by our team extensively. It was only after I requested help because it wasn\'t working that I was informed that Conga will no longer support it as the app did when it was Action Grid. We had to purchase another product and pay for custom development to be able to browse multiple records from a grid view.<br/><br/>Support for the grid product is not very good. We began using the product when it was Action Grid and there is an obvious change in product knowledge and support since being purchased by Conga. Conga doesn\'t provide support for custom actions at all for this product, and it is difficult to find knowledgeable help when you encounter a real problem. You have to go through a series of submitting a support case, scheduling a screen share to show your problem to someone, then that person takes the problem higher up and gets back to you (sometimes). It\'s truly disappointing. <br/><br/>The base product still works okay in Classic (allowing 2 stars), that is viewing multiple records in a grid format and doing mass updates.<br/><br/>Considering all SF users will need to eventually transition to lightning, I would not recommend this product.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000IVO3GEAX', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000BMKbqAAH', 'reviewer_name': 'Lindsay Sutula', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jun 17, 2015 at 1:37 PM', 'review_title': 'Drives value for the whole marketing team', 'review_description': "ActionGrid’s segmentation features including grouping, filtering and the amazing Drill Down/Up functions have allowed me to easily create targeted marketing campaigns with just a few clicks.

First, their support is second to none. They respond extremely quickly and, so far, have had an answer to all my problems or requests.

If you are NOT familiar with Excel, you will learn to use Action Grid in 5 minutes. Seriously.<br/><br/>I recommend you come up with a few specific scenarios you want to use Action Grid for and call support to walk you through the best way to get the views you need. That will teach you a lot of what you need to know about using Action Grid.<br/><br/>For example, I wanted to see:<br/>1. Which Opportunities did not have Contact Roles assigned<br/>2. Which Opportunities had no dollar values in them yet<br/><br/>It took less than a minute to set up each view and save them for future use. Now I can run these views with a click and then, this is the best part, edit the missing info right inside the list view! Woo hoo! <br/><br/>I've only had Action Grid for a short while but my head is filling with ideas for views that will get me info very quickly without building reports."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000IV3RDEA1', 'reviewer_id': '00530000009c6ZkAAI', 'reviewer_name': 'John Dick', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'May 23, 2015 at 5:45 PM', 'review_title': 'Superb Customer Support', 'review_description': "I rarely write reviews.

The App allows a business user to pull large number of fields and allows to adjust the field on the fly. The User Interface is flexible and clean, one can drag and drop the columns for instance to re-org them. The filters at the top of each column are incredibly powerful, with embedded google-like search. A lot of attention to details went into the filters, including the date filters. The price is right. The support is excellent. The team is using agile to develop, pushing frequent updates and bug fixes, and i value that. The App works in Professional edition and does not require API.<br/><br/>Issues: We run into performance issues which they helped us address in collaboration with the SF support staff. They also made adjustments to a few UI issues along the way. The performance is now adequate.<br/><br/>Area for improvement: i wish one wouldn't have to be in edit mode to do in-line editing (Gridbuddy is good for that).<br/><br/>Overall, an impressive App if you are looking to give your business users a spreadsheet-like experience in Salesforce, with stellar support."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000IUJ1HEAX', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000AIelCAAT', 'reviewer_name': 'Cassidy Rush', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Mar 26, 2015 at 8:13 AM', 'review_title': 'Very impressive so far', 'review_description': "I'll say that we just got this app into production, but that so far user reaction has been uniformly positive and CRMCulture customer service has been over-the-top outstanding.

One of the biggest benefits we’ve seen from ECM is that we now have that one central place to put in all of our programs &amp; services. It’s really valuable to view clients across multiple programs, both in the past and in real time. We like that the out-of-the-box tool is already set up to map our basic business processes of intake, assessments, and case records, which would otherwise have to be created from scratch. <br/> <br/>I think the client household model is helpful as well, because we work with families, and Salesforce is not natively set up that way. Reporting has also become a lot more seamless for us. The framework is flexible enough to build other forms and features too, and for some programs we’ve configured unique components like a housing tracker. It’s been great having the support of the team at Exponent Partners; they’re really responsive!'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000J81q7UAB', 'reviewer_id': '00530000009b84DAAQ', 'reviewer_name': 'Michelle Portlock', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jun 27, 2016 at 6:43 PM', 'review_title': 'An app developed with an understanding of nonprofit operations', 'review_description': 'In our annual IT satisfaction survey the user satisfaction with Exponent Case Management was about 92%. Most systems don’t have satisfaction that high. <br/><br/>It’s fantastic to have a system that covers over 25 of our programs, and lets us report within and across programs. We can use the framework of ECM but customize it to each of our different services, from health to family services to employment. That was a huge priority for us when selecting a new system. We didn’t want to be tied to something that we couldn’t, to some extent, manage ourselves. The system will never really be “done” – we continue to engage with staff to make it even more useful. Staff have come up with lots of ideas about new features and we can be very responsive. Small changes like a new field or a new option on a picklist can be made very quickly, often within the day. Osborne was one of the first adopters of ECM, so we were able to work with Exponent Partners as they were developing the system. We started implementation about 3 years ago and are using a version that pre-dates the current managed package, but the framework is the same. <br/><br/>The overall ease of use is much higher than with our old system. Entering group services is an area where users have had some difficulties, so we’ve created more user documentation and training around that. Reporting is much simpler and staff are now using real-time, custom dashboards. Direct service staff track their active caseloads and managers see real-time performance dashboards, in ways that weren’t previously possible. The application has changed the way we work -- the assistance with our work process has been very helpful. Staff get reminders of deadlines, milestones, or service follow-ups. They used to track those things in calendars or Excel or other ways that just created more work, but now that kind of tracking is built into our solution. It’s part of why staff really see value in ECM as a tool to help them manage their work.'}]

Sure perhaps you could write a trigger or pay someone to write a trigger to do this stuff, but having a team of admins that can build them and edit them as needed without dev help is worth the annual cost for this app. Technical support for this app is also incredible - the team helped us troubleshoot an issue we were having, and remained fully engaged and dedicated until it was solved (shout out to Eric Johansen!).

Using the standard UI in SFDC was not going to work because were were using custom formula fields that we wanted to use as values to rollup. Using Rollup helper we were able to add over 20 custom fields to rollup to our custom object and our commission object is now working great. We had a few issues along the way, but reaching out to passagetech was a breeze and they were on top of everything very quickly making sure we were able to use their tool without any issues occuring. I would highly recommend this app if you need rollup functionality that SFDC basic UI can't help you do."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000Hd3VAEAZ', 'reviewer_id': '00530000005mqyjAAA', 'reviewer_name': 'Yuko Takagi', 'rating_stars': '40', 'review_date': 'Mar 18, 2013 at 12:07 PM', 'review_title': 'must have app', 'review_description': 'This app is great.

If you have custom objects with business data in Salesforce, or if you integrate Salesforce with your back-end ERP/Accounting system, displaying sales data for customers, this is the missing link that allows you to add up all sorts of sales and performance metrics and display them in a field in the account. I.e., Year-to-date sales, year-to-date gross margin, number of event type "customer visit" in the last 12 months, number of support hours left on customer account, total amount of past due invoices etc.<br/><br/>And the summarized field triggers workflows. So if you want an email to be automatically sent to any customers who reach X dollars past due or who run out of pre-paid support hours, the field summarized by this app triggers the workflow for it. Oh yeah.<br/><br/>You may say "Salesforce has a feature that does that - Roll-up summary fields!" But it\'s way too limited: the summaries don\'t work for event/task data, don\'t work for formulas which involve a date variable (i.e., amount of invoices past due, year-to-date opportunity $ closed) and the summarized data doesn\'t trigger workflows.<br/><br/>This app overcomes all those issues.<br/><br/>We installed the free edition right after this app was launched, in September 2012. But had to upgrade to the paid enterprise edition when they capped the data usage in the free edition. If you\'re summing one data field from Cases into Accounts (say support hours used) you\'ll be fine with this version. If however you\'re importing thousands of invoices and hundreds of thousands of invoice line items (in custom objects) and adding them up to hundreds of accounts - well, then you\'ll need the Enterprise edition.<br/><br/>5 stars for the life-changing functionality.

While it does overcome the rollup summary field limit Salesforce imposes, which in itself makes it worthwhile, what makes it invaluable is that it can do so much more than a standard rollup field. The Salesforce admin will no longer be constrained by the source field type – you can do a rollup on other rollups, formula fields, even text fields if you just want a list or subset list to appear on the parent record. And it doesn’t have to be a Master-Detail relationship, it will work on your lookup relationships too. You can use most any field as a criterion to filter your rollup. So for those clicks-vs.-code types out there (like me) and for those who don’t want to spend the time, money, and effort writing code to overcome the Salesforce limits, this app is a must-have.<br/><br/>As for service, the team at Passage Tech is very responsive. If you need help getting started (I’m not suggesting you will; the interface is pretty intuitive), they are just a phone call or email away. For complicated cases, an engineer will help you map it out, build it in your sandbox, and when ready, put through the change set into your production environment.<br/><br/>We tested the free app first, and then quickly migrated to the paid version and put our two rollups into real time – including a text rollup. We then tried our most complex use case (thinking if we can get this one to work, the other 5 cases will be easy). Our use case spanned 6 objects, involved 32 fields, 5 of which were rollup fields for which we used Rollup Helper. It included two custom junction objects, three standard objects, a custom object, formula fields, standard rollup fields, master-detail relationships and lookup relationships – and with some mapping, a couple conversations with an engineer, we tested the result and have it up and running.<br/><br/>For the price, I highly recommend this app for Salesforce admins.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000HbR6LEAV', 'reviewer_id': '00530000007KoDTAA0', 'reviewer_name': 'Mark Miller', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Dec 10, 2012 at 12:15 PM', 'review_title': 'Fills a big gap', 'review_description': 'Rollup fields are a vital feature of Salesforce, but the out of the box field type is limited in a number of ways.

It takes a lot of admin time to re-create some documents (e.g. government forms only available to me in PDF).<br/>- Only being able to go down one level for related object lists. This required us to create a few process builder work-arounds to associate (for example) some custom object records with the Account where originally they were only in a relationship to the Contact.<br/>- Limited filtering, sorting, transforming options within the doc gen engine. The work-around is always to create a new formula field, but it would be nice to do some of the transformations within the document generation step instead of creating a bunch of fields only used for doc gen.<br/><br/>These cons basically equate to more admin time necessary to set up the documents.

"I have 8000 contacts. You have to break up your sync into chunks of less than 5000 to sync. That in itself isn\'t a major problem, although it took some time go figure it out. The BIG ISSUE is this. The sync works fine from Salesforce to Google, but when you turn on the sync Google to Salesforce, it seems the API calls go sky high (1 per contact), so you quickly get to the Saleforce limit of 5000, making that feature useless. This means you can\'t have a bi-directional sync. Might as well just export sales force contacts and import to google. Bah ..."<br/><br/>BUT THEN ... was contacted by Jeff from Appirio. He reset things and we started again. He spend over an hour with me. We saw some interesting sync results, and he explained what they were. (I had previously synced between google and outlook, and this was the first time syncing between google and salesforce). The program picked up a number of issues between the fields.<br/><br/>Net-Net, after about an hour, we got google and salesforce to sync perfectly. For $4 bucks a month, I\'m amazed that they would spend so much time with me.<br/><br/>Later in the evening, I wanted to make sure the sync was working both ways, so I modified a few dozen contacts n google. I resynced. BAM ... I ended up with over 1000 duplicates, absolutely identical records in Google. I was told earlier in the day that Google Merge works pretty good. Not So. It merges contacts with the same first/last name even though the email addresses are different. So, I couldn\'t merge. I ended up deleting the entire google contact list, then started the one way sync from Saleforce to Google, one alphabet letter at a time. Long story short, got about 2/3 the way and ran into the 5000 api limit again.<br/><br/>NET - NET ... this simple app seems to be way to sensitive to who knows what.

On the fence regarding contacts', 'review_description': "This app is great for the calendar sync. By using it, you can achieve the nirvana of having your salesforce calendar sync to google and google sync to each users mobile devices, flawlessly. After setting up, it just works, perfectly, without issues or glitches, and it works both ways. Worth noting that you can't sync a public calendar in google to salesforce or vice-versa. It also syncs only once per hour as of Jan/2012, so if you create a meeting for a user in 45 minutes, it might not push to his/her gmail/phone. It is great that you can create an appointment in Google on your phone, it will show up later in SF and then you can attach it to a contact/case/lead/opportunity. In our company we have salespeople report on their activities and this makes it just so much easier to get all their activities in salesforce without creating a data-entry burden.<br/><br/>As a side note, most calendar functions in new phones and devices allow you to sync separately with multiple devices. That is good because you can tell your users to put their personal appointments in their other email account. They'll still see both on their phones and get reminders, but their private appointments won't show up in Salesforce ;-)<br/><br/>Contact sync, however, is more useful as an initial automated and easy contact dump from Google to SF than an ongoing sync. The issues are: (1) you end up creating a lot of orphan contacts in SF; (2) the filtering abilities are so-so when selecting contacts to sync from SF to Google; (3) support says Appirio does not support syncing the company and title in the contact from one system to the other (I got it to work once, not sure how) which makes it not so useful; (4) it can only sync 5k contacts at a time (combine that with insufficient contact filters and, if you have SF with more than 20 users, you'll definitely have more than that number of contacts).<br/><br/>I think it's worth the price even if only for the calendar sync."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000DOQVbEAP', 'reviewer_id': '005300000068HfjAAE', 'reviewer_name': 'Ken Cren', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jan 23, 2012 at 6:35 PM', 'review_title': 'Solid Google Apps Sync', 'review_description': 'Great app to sync your contacts and calendars from Google Apps to SFDC.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000DO301EAD', 'reviewer_id': '005300000067rw2AAA', 'reviewer_name': 'Damien Renouf', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jan 17, 2012 at 10:14 AM', 'review_title': 'Great synchronization', 'review_description': 'Definitely one of the best application in Google integration apps category.<br/>Just love using Google apps...'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000DNmpuEAD', 'reviewer_id': '005300000051fFBAAY', 'reviewer_name': 'Sundar Kamu', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jan 13, 2012 at 10:41 AM', 'review_title': 'Easy to Install and Use - Good Features', 'review_description': 'This is one of the best application in Google integration apps category.

InsightSquared does a lot of great things that I personally haven't seen other analytics companies do. The product has opened our eyes and real helped us to better understand our pipeline and bookings. One of the biggest difference makers and something that we were never able to track previous to implementing InsightSquared was tracking pipeline history, being able to see a detailed view of how our pipeline and deals change over time is excellent. It is very intuitive and easy to use and navigate. There are many reports already created in the system that are beneficial so once you are up and running you already of many reports created for you to use and analyze at your disposal. Dashboards are easy to create and many templates readily available to make it even easier. There's much to like about this product and company.<br/><br/>Customization and custom reports have been the only challenge for our business. Outside of their pre-built reports, custom reports are very limited and if your business has a unique way of looking at certain data points or you have a report that is more advanced looking at multiple pieces of data you may have a hard time implementing these into Insightsquared. That being said their support and customer happiness team are available for calls and discussions to help get you what you need.

They send you an email, you click on it, then a day later your account is provisioned. Nothing could be easier. Finally, it is cost effective. They only bill you for the user licenses that put data into the system. So if you have 20 sellers carrying a book, you pay for 20 licenses. You need to have access for 50 people?

Response from support (one of our must-haves) is nearly instantaneous – it's e-mail support so it could be ignored or delayed, but it’s not. Their staff stays with the project and the inevitable tweaks until they've solved the problem or created a solution. Pricing is fair and reasonable – we've had essentially no push-back from our customers, except they asked us to include fees in the ticket price. We did that, and they're happy with only adding a small order fee. It takes a little bit of experimentation to figure the best fee structure so that fees essentially pay for everything, and we monitor that carefully. With single tickets, we charge the same fees whether or not they’re bought on line, by phone, or in person, cash, check or c.c. Our aim is to drive the “easy” traffic to the web so that box office personnel are free to deal with more complicated issues, fixing problems, etc. Transitions take care and patience and training and sometimes a bit of CHANGE in the way you do business, but PM has been there when we've asked. Every time we've had an issue that we classify as a critical wrinkle for the way we do business and what our audience expects, they've gone to work on it. And they “get” box offices: never have I heard the words “well, nobody else has ever asked for that. Why would you want to do that?” By the way, the system works: all of our income records - tickets, donations, tuition - go through PatronManager. And we're just scratching the surface in terms of reporting and development tracking - there's plenty of room and system for us to get better."}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000000g5bHEAQ', 'reviewer_id': '005300000096jtTAAQ', 'reviewer_name': 'Philip Lehl', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jan 30, 2015 at 1:02 PM', 'review_title': 'The BEST Support Ever', 'review_description': "We have been using PatronManager for our Box Office for several years now, and we're very happy with the platform.<br/>But the best thing for us has been when we need help: PatronManager's Customer Support is incredibly fast and helpful.

If you know HTML &amp; CSS you can really make your quotes tailored to your needs. <br/><br/>The only draw back (and this is NOT GoCloudz issue) is Salesforce\'s Rich Text editor. Because they (Salesforce) only give you very basic formatting options, yet QuotePDF gives you creative freedom, you\'ll find that you may be shackled trying to implement your quote designs to their true potential.

We had unique requirements for our bundling needs, and after investigated multiple solutions it became obvious that GoCloudz not only had the best product, but also was among the most affordable. More importantly, however, I can corroborate all the comments that the experience was made even better due to the phenomenal customer support. <br/><br/>I was shocked when, literally minutes after downloading a trial version of the product, I received a call from a support engineer who reviewed my company\'s goals and needs, and suggested various options for me to consider. He provided advice on other products they offer without ever giving me the pushy hard sell, and worked hand in hand with me throughout the process to ensure the product was customized to meet our needs. Response was always fast and helpful, and in addition to the customization fees being very reasonable, the timeline for release was rapid.<br/><br/>Like many companies, we needed to empower our reps to easily add convenient pre-built product bundles to opportunities, and then to generate professional customer facing price quotes and order forms displaying these bundles. Our unique problem, however, was that these bundles represented products which needed to hit different revenue GL accounts when pushed from Salesforce to our integrated accounting system. GoCloudz was able to build a custom button which allowed our finance staff to "decompose" the bundle after the sale was complete, and therefore push a fully itemized invoice through to the accounting system without disrupting the sales process. <br/><br/>The only other product I found which could meet our needs was an outrageously expensive, enterprise level CPQ solution which would have required months of deployment time and heavy customization.

We won’t have to customize Salesforce programmatically to make it behave more like Excel (which it could never truly be). And happily we no longer need to suffer the limits of "export to” and “data loader” because the two systems are now appropriately linked.<br/><br/>Well done Apttus!'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000HrvZCEAZ', 'reviewer_id': '00530000004cdslAAA', 'reviewer_name': 'Tyler Turner', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Sep 04, 2014 at 2:23 PM', 'review_title': 'Apptus X-Author for Excel GREAT PRODUCT', 'review_description': 'My company recently purchased the Apptus X-Author for Excel product. So far, I am extremely pleased. This product allows for mass updates to records on any Object via Excel. The product has great functionality that lets the "Designer" build applications with specific security features to allow end users the ability to export records and make endless mass updates to a variety of records. The product is easy to install, the Instruction Guide is simple to follow, and the Customer Service in responding to any question/request. This product is relatively inexpensive and a great value add to any Org. Time is the real ROI for this product as my sales reps can now make a host of updates in seconds vs. updating SF directly with many clicks.'}]

So I\'m a single user (sending and receiving less than 100 texts monthly) and it appears they are charging for a multi user account.

Thanks Amol!!<br/><br/>I also worked with Johnson and Abhishek on installing SMS Converse onto our production organization and the support that I received from both of them was amazing! They were super helpful anytime I had questions or need a quick demo recap of a new feature or anything else. Abhishek also spent a weekend updating existing workflows to make sure our organization did not fall behind when the work week started back up.

After 4 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars of staff and development time in trying to integrate an SMS function, they finally gave up on the project and decided to not pursue SMS communications. IMHO it was a critical error on their part. <br/><br/>Fast forward 4 months into my new role with a different non-profit organization that has Salesforce as the underlaying CRM, and in less than TWO WEEKS and for a very affordable flat rate, SMS Magic is up and running, the workflows automated for incoming messages to our Box Office, workflows set up for outbound messages to segmented groups, and automatic message receipts outbound when messages are received outside of normal business hours. It's mind-blowing. <br/><br/>The team at Screen-Magic/SMS Magic were helpful, very easy to work with, and walked through the set up in a very easy and proficient manner. I had never used Salesforce before taking this job, and their process flow and ability to walk me through the customer object set up and workflows was greatly appreciated. <br/><br/>The pricing may have seemed like a big annual chuck for our non-profit, but the happy customers we have now, who are all on their mobile devices anyway and are used to texting questions, is worth every penny. Having the information in text format that is connected to a customer record gives us a clear communication trail our staff can follow if there is an issue, and the customer has in very clear written terms an answer to their question. We also make extensive use of the program to send out pre-event messages, parking alerts, and updates. <br/><br/>A huge thank you to the entire team at Screen-Magic for helping to bring us into the 21st Century, and communicating with our patrons in the way they want us to - via text message."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000Jqz6QUAR', 'reviewer_id': '0053A00000DLwZBQA1', 'reviewer_name': 'Paul Carass', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jun 05, 2018 at 9:17 AM', 'review_title': 'An Amazing Product, and support team to go with it!', 'review_description': "SMS magic have been a revelation for our business and how we interact with our customers.<br/>As well have having a great product, their support team have been outstanding.

Most of this development takes place after hours and way into the night. I can’t tell you how many times I've been working at 1am-2am and have run into an area that I’m unfamiliar with and need further assistance or training on. So, I send out an email to the support team fully expecting them to get back to me sometime the next day. However, every time, I have received a return email from Pramod Varma, on their support team with the exact information and help I need with in 5-10 minutes of sending me email.

It behaves like it was coded by a first year uni student. It's riddled with unhandled bugs, an absolutely useless merge engine, unused fields, and triggers that cannot be turned off or run in a test class.<br/><br/>If you want to do anything at all beyond the base offering, just install the app and hope it reliably works. Otherwise, it's better to start from scratch with your own integration.<br/><br/>Some specific issues:<br/>1. The apex documentation is incomplete and there is no documentation on the SObjects or fields. What does exist, like the Apex code available, appears to be horribly out of date and unfinished.<br/><br/>2. The Incoming SMS trigger chains async jobs or uses a small batch size that prohibits bulk inserts in a test class<br/><br/>3. Many of the fields on the SObjects released with the package are unused<br/><br/>4. The SObjects and fields released with the package are inconsistently named<br/><br/>5. The package is very inflexible. If you want to do anything beyond whats included (which is basically nothing), don't use this package.<br/><br/>6. The template merge field Apex methods exposed are buggy and useless. First, it's difficult, if not impossible, to match the input SMS template text to the output text - thus making it useless and showing some very poor planning. Secondly, it cannot be plugged into a user exposed page, as any errors that occur (which can occur easily), cause an undescriptive and unhandled exception. A basic merge engine isn't that large of a job. My beta replacement was done in a night. Why are we paying for an integration where a whole development team cannot implement basic functionality?<br/><br/>Overall, a very poor and useless package that looks like it was thrown together without testing.

Smooth integration with our Salesforce and quality people. Helped us work through a fairly complex use case as well wherein we wanted to develop campaigns around texting."<br/><br/>I am amending this review. <br/><br/>It\'s possible something changed with the company because the current scenario is polar opposite from the time we started working with SMS Magic. In the past three months, the following things have happened. 1) Our account manager left the company and no one informed us. As a result, numerous requests all around expansion and growth were ignored causing a major loss in confidence with our new markets around technology and this capability. 2) A case surrounding notification of an incoming SMS message from a client is still open since the time we started. I understand that some cases are complex but all we want to be able to ensure is that the salesperson who SENT the initial text message receives any notification if the client texts back. The ideal...is they would get notification on their cell phone but we\'ve relented and said email is fine (SMS can\'t text to the cell phone btw...out of the box) however all emails are sent to the OAuth User and not the last sender. Imagine a scenario where an agent is reaching out via text through Salesforce to a potential lead about buying a top tier product at a high volume, and the lead texts back - "Yes, but I need more info...." and the agent isn\'t notified of that text. Instead the Salesforce Admin at HQ receives this notification amongst thousands of other ones. <br/><br/>I realize some of this falls on us as the administration team but all we get back from SMS are Word Documents. There was a time where support would get on a screenshare to diagnose the problem. That time has apparently passed.<br/><br/>Could not be more disappointed in this product and will be looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Beware.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000HzUWpUAN', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000Bi5rkAAB', 'reviewer_name': 'Ryan Skidmore', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Feb 23, 2017 at 1:56 PM', 'review_title': 'Great tool', 'review_description': "Well...

Increased Conversion Rates', 'review_description': 'It took us about 3 months to research all of the different SMS apps for Salesforce and we finally decided on Magic SMS. It has helped us in our business immensely. With today\'s reliance on technology, phones, and social media, consumers are much more willing to answer a text over a phone call. We have a 70% response rate with this text messaging app. The time that we save by using this app is worth every penny! We think of it as another employee and "investment" rather than an expense. We use the individual "send SMS" feature often but what really sets it apart from many other apps is that it has merge fields (the ability to pull information from the contact page so you can send the same template to multiple users like first name, last name, close of escrow date, and so on). This helps with personalizing the text message without having to write it out each time. The workflows are also a life-saver! You can set text messages to go out automatically once a rule is triggered. The support team is amazing and they have always worked so hard to help me with any questions or requests that I\'ve had (I personally work with Indranil and Utkarsh). I have never had an issue getting in touch with them, they are very responsive. I have recommended this program to many people and will continue to recommend it. It may appear a little pricey compared to other programs, but the functionality and output of the system will make you your money back 10 times over. Just a note: setting up the system may seem daunting but the support team does most of the work for you upfront. Like any piece of technology, there is a learning curve and that should be an expectation when purchasing a program like this.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JNstsUAD', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000BKkJpAAL', 'reviewer_name': 'Steve Goff', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jun 06, 2016 at 10:37 AM', 'review_title': 'Easy to setup and use', 'review_description': 'The app was easy to setup and use and I just handed the app over to my admissions team and they took off with it.

We can set up goals/contests/objectives for all of our different functional teams. The wizard to set up objectives is easy to use, and that combined with the sample objectives that come with Corsica make it easy to get started with powerful motivators very quickly. We also really like how the badges provide a history of past achievements. This is a powerful application that makes a real difference in what we as an organization are capable of achieving."}]
