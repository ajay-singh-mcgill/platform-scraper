In addition we wanted the software to (1) Create new accounts in SAGE from Salesforce and (2) Create new Sales Orders in SAGE from Quotes in Salesforce.<br/><br/>Through the first 18 months of this implementation (through June 2018), the sync stopped working continually. Support would/could not tell me why. I tried to elevate my own case (no response from my sales rep). In January 2018, I was assigned a new account manager to help resolve my issues, but nothing improved. So in June, I posted my frustration here on the app exchange. I was promptly contacted by the management team at Commercient. They explained that they would fix my issues, and they did. The sync is currently functioning properly.<br/><br/>Pros: When functioning, the software will bring in everything you have in the SAGE tables, and sync periodically (X times per day) to managed custom objects. This unlocks a lot of potential through the Salesforce reporting, automation and alert functionality. We have invested a lot of time in this middleware, so I am hoping it will run smoothly<br/><br/>Cons: Support is slow to resolve issues. My support tickets have taken 1-2 weeks on average to resolve (sample size 20 tickets). Each time we have a ticket open, someone must make telecon calls with support so that they can manipulate the on premise software. This can be time-consuming.<br/><br/>The system provides no alert when it stops syncing, so you must monitor it. Any change to SAGE install or to the SAGE tables syncing can cause it to stop syncing.<br/><br/>Lastly, the software is more expensive than we anticipated. We were surprised that our rates jumped after the first year (we thought we had signed a 3 year contract). A per user model can make this much more expensive than the competitors if you grow.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JuuD9UAJ', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000CWAWxAAP', 'reviewer_name': 'David Wieder', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Oct 16, 2017 at 2:11 PM', 'review_title': "Couldn't be Happier!!", 'review_description': "Commercient has delivered exactly what we needed - all of our Sage data synced to Salesforce.

If you have custom objects with business data in Salesforce, or if you integrate Salesforce with your back-end ERP/Accounting system, displaying sales data for customers, this is the missing link that allows you to add up all sorts of sales metrics and display them in a field in the account. I.e., Year-to-date sales, year-to-date gross margin, number of event type "customer visit" in the last 12 months, number of support hours left on customer account, total amount of past due invoices etc.<br/><br/>And the summarized field triggers workflows. So if you want an email to be automatically sent to any customers who reach X dollars past due or who run out of pre-paid support hours, this app triggers the workflow for it. Oh yeah.<br/><br/>You may say "Salesforce has a feature that does that - Roll-up summary fields!" But it\'s way too limited: the summaries don\'t work for event/task data, don\'t work for formulas which involve a date variable (i.e., amount of invoices past due, year-to-date opportunity $ closed) and the summarized data doesn\'t trigger workflows.<br/><br/>This app overcomes all those issues.<br/><br/>We installed the free edition right after this app was launched, in September 2012. The developers however crippled the free version over time. This is understandable since they need to keep costs down for this version. By crippling I mean capping the amount of data that can be added up. If you\'re summing one data field from Cases into Accounts (say support hours used) you\'ll be fine with this version. If however you\'re importing thousands of invoices and hundreds of thousands of invoice line items (in custom objects) and adding them up to hundreds of accounts - well, then you\'ll need the Enterprise edition.<br/><br/>5 stars for the life-changing functionality. 3 stars for capping data usage. 4-star final grade.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000HbkDjEAJ', 'reviewer_id': '00530000003TTvZAAW', 'reviewer_name': 'Johan Yu', 'rating_stars': '30', 'review_date': 'Jan 01, 2013 at 5:19 AM', 'review_title': 'Great app', 'review_description': 'This app pretty cool, it is simple and working good.

A separate system was used to process and clear the deductions or request the cheques. No reports could be pulled to see where in the process we were sitting.

The reps would also keep track of their payments separately on their own excel reports against various programs.

We are extremely happy with our decision and want to share our experience.<br/><br/>We decided upon a cloud-based solution for ERP, and after exploring two other popular integrated suites, we met with Rootstock and engaged them a month later. The Rootstock salespeople completely spoke the language of manufacturing. I felt like they knew more about our business processes than we did—everyone in the company understands manufacturing IT. <br/><br/>When we asked Rootstock if their system could do something, they either proved that it could, or they added it to their roadmap for future releases. Almost everything on those roadmaps has now been added. I deal with about 20 different people at Rootstock; each of them brings something different to the table, but they all help. They all understand the role of technology in manufacturing. <br/><br/>During the first step in implementation, someone from Rootstock discusses and maps your business processes. You then put some dummy data into your Sandbox and model all the transactions. Once you’re happy with the Sandbox, you can move into production mode. We had a big job in gathering, formatting and importing data, but we leaned on Rootstock throughout the process.<br/><br/>We signed the contract in August, did the modeling in September, testing in October and training in November and December. We went live on January 1st. <br/><br/>Our workforce have had no issues adopting Rootstock; it’s designed so that an order cannot be shipped without going through the workflow that we’ve set up. <br/><br/>Rootstock issues updates almost every week. We are using Rootstock in ways that differ from companies that manufacture electrical circuits or mix paint, so we’ve done some workarounds. After updates, our workarounds might not work, but the support process is simple, fast, and fluid.

We are excited by the fact that we were able to implement an entirely new financial system including the kind of robust feature set previously only available from legacy vendors configured as on-premise solutions in only 6 months from pilot to go live.

The "platform within a platform" leverages nearly all Salesforce templating and automation tools including Process Builder, along with Community licensing, so the ability to scale is ensured. The new video-player inside of Chatter puts ViewTrac functionality well ahead of the pack. The Appinium team provides continuous development, and excellent deployment support; these folks want to make sure that your LMS is a success! Appinium should do more with their documentation, so that feature concepts and the interrelationships between objects is crystal clear at project start. No doubt they will do that, and until then, (like a lot of AppExchange products), a little persistence gets you there.

None of the other LMS vendors we researched were more knowledgeable about this industry. This experience is one of the few times our team of recalcitrant professors, lawyers, analysts and obstinate executives has unanimously felt there is no better vendor out there.

Wait. What? Yes. The social hire app will not integrate with your website on the professional level license of salesforce. <br/>There isn't any literature on the social hire site regarding this, which obviously, was frustrating and ended up costing me more money as I had to upgrade to the Enterprise edition. Now, in all reality, we probably could have just went with the force.com license, which is WAY cheaper than any of the salesforce licenses (of course none of the salesforce reps recommended this), but salesforce doesn't let you downgrade the license so we had to upgrade to enterprise..CHA-CHING! (to get FULL functionality of the social hire app on your website, you have to have access to 'sites' within the 'setup' menu).<br/>Now, aside from ALL that, this app is G R E A T and their customer support (Pradip &amp; Girish) is even better. You would be foolish to pay other companies (up to $300 a month) to implement an employee tracking system, plus with salesforce, the ability to use Chatter is a team communication game-changer, in my opinion. <br/>Some of you may be using your own developer, but personally, I would just budget the $$ and use the guys at Social Hire to do it. <br/>Side note: make sure your developer understands CSS and responsiveness (web/tablet/mobile); not going to make sense to use this if it only works within an iframe for desktop but not mobile or tablet. <br/>The only thing I wish this app had: an email notification when a new applicant is submitted.

First and foremost, we have found everyone at Financial Force, from Sales to Support to the Development team to be highly responsive, easily approachable, and very eager to understand our needs, seek out our improvement ideas, and help us best utilize their product as it fits our operation - nothing seems off the table to ask for help!<br/> <br/>As for the SCM solution, some of our most pressing and immediate needs were met simply by bringing all our systems under one umbrella onto the force.com platform – thus greatly reducing redundancies, bottlenecks, and communication problems. It was FF SCM’s design and degree of flexibility that allowed this transition to be virtually seamless to our users. We were also attracted to and rely heavily on FF SCM’s lot traceability, SOP to POP direct shipments, landed cost/laid-in-freight, multiple warehouse inventory tracking and transfers, and BOM/production orders – all very easy to use features. Additionally, we have found the reporting function to be robust and user-friendly for daily metrics reporting, exception handling, and overall management. As we progress, we continue to realize significant time-savings across our operations, particularly with the “drill around” and global search function, both providing tremendous visibility and access to real-time information. <br/> <br/>The Financial Force team has become a great partner for us as we continue to grow and develop. Our overall experience has made us eager to move our financial management and accounting function over to FFA solution in the near future.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000J81qgUAB', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000BR8UQAA1', 'reviewer_name': 'Nicolas Urena', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jun 27, 2016 at 9:18 PM', 'review_title': 'Highly Recommended', 'review_description': 'As a FinancialForce partner, we do not hesitate in recommending the Supply Chain module to our customers looking to gain greater control and manage their supply chain needs, no matter the complexities involved.<br/><br/>In particular, FinancialForce’s SCM suite enables our customers to gain crucial insights and crystal-clear, real time visibility of every step in their supply chain - resulting in improved inventory accuracy, greater available resource visibility and stronger contract management.<br/><br/>As cloud-solution experts, we come across a number of solutions that offer supply chain management tools, but time and time again the FinancialForce SCM suite finds it’s way towards the top of the pile.

When we met FF, they said it would take more work and money to integrate our custom quoting engine with FF than for us to buy their SCM package. We had a tight timeline, but they agreed it could be done. We dumped our custom quote project with about 80% done, and went with FF / SCM.<br/><br/>In our experience, the developers who were part of the sales process were clearly more knowledgeable than the implementation specialist. We were told that what we were seeing as a demo was a ‘finished product.’ Far from it. We’ve incurred extra costs(by a lot) for outside developers and part timers to do manually what FF/SCM said would be part of the system. <br/><br/>The front line troops at FF/SCM were sincerely trying, but are under resources, poorly trained and not supported. As we climbed up the chain, we got a lot of lip service about wanting to make us happy, but they wouldn't respond in a timely manner, ignored the fact that they under quoted the price, shrugged off the fact that we had to incur outside costs, and couldn't get the higher ups to respond. <br/><br/>The basic reply to us was that they had already put in many more hours than they scoped… they under scoped the project, and admitted doing so. But, that was somehow our burden.<br/><br/>I think this product could be great. But, they need to stop selling it for a while and button it up, give their staff time to understand their own tools, and be more upfront regarding their own senior management’s lack of interest in the challenges their poor planning and resourcing creates for their own people and their customers."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000HrM2LEAV', 'reviewer_id': '00530000001s3isAAA', 'reviewer_name': 'AppExchange - English Site Guest User', 'rating_stars': '30', 'review_date': 'Jul 17, 2014 at 4:03 PM', 'review_title': 'Great Product', 'review_description': "The SCM Product has helped our business achieve greater efficiency and has added much needed controls.

The team at Veevart have helped guide us through this process and the product itself has integrated fairly seamlessly with our existing systems. <br/><br/>Veevart has now replaced a number of antiquated systems.

Focusing on customer satisfaction has been a key ingredient to our success and depends a great deal on our ability to fulfill the customer’s needs in a timely manner. We build our systems to order and are usually able to ship on the same day we receive the order. Almost all of our products are shipped within 24 hours of the order. To achieve this objective of rapid shipment, on increasing sales, we need to have accurate data that is easy to interpret on a system used by diverse personnel ranging from management, sales, marketing, production and shipping. <br/><br/>We were looking at creating custom applications in Salesforce to manage Order Fulfillment. We were using Mail Merge and email templates for Quotes, Sales Orders, Shipping Instructions, Pack List and RMAs. Mail Merge and email templates, while useful were a bit cumbersome because we have a mix of Mac and PC computers and there are a lot of extra steps required for the Mac users because none of the automation Salesforce built into Outlook could be used by our Sales personnel.<br/><br/>The Glovia system eliminates all the extra steps by having buttons that turn Opportunities into Quotes, Quotes into Sales Orders and Sales Orders into shipping orders and documentation. At each stage there is a button to simply email the pdf form. Initially we took the unnecessary step of working in a Sandbox. Glovia integrates over the top of the existing Salesforce framework without stepping all over our current customizations. This means that development can be done on the production environment and exposed when you are ready to switch over.<br/><br/>Our next steps will be to customize the documents, link the data to Quickbooks and our Order Fulfillment house’s database so we can view our entire sales to fulfillment process and inventory in a singular place and reduce the time spent managing inventory in Quickbook’s limited GUI.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000000xVEuEAM', 'reviewer_id': '00530000001sAZVAA2', 'reviewer_name': 'Seth Klugman', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Mar 18, 2009 at 4:16 PM', 'review_title': 'Excellent Product', 'review_description': "This product very nicely integrates into Salesforce and has all the necessary functionality to effectively manage inventory.

My end game was to automate task assignment from Pardot to Salesforce while concurrently creating the ability to assign contacts who reside in specific territories to dynamic mailing lists in Pardot. The RealZips app, combined with the RealTerritories module, had our Salesforce org in tip-top shape in less than a day! This would have taken me AT LEAST a year to manage on my own! And because RealZips is scalable, modular and plays nice with other Salesforce objects and fields, I\'m now left with the most powerful marketing automation tool I\'ve ever used. <br/><br/>Fred takes ownership not only with the app, itself, but with the project at-hand. He personally guides you through every step of the process, explains the logic behind HOW and WHY things work the way they do and strives to be a constant partner through the entire process. He\'s also very knowledgeable with the Salesforce core and helps break down processes in a way that the Salesforce tech support can\'t. No more useless, verbose Salesforce knowledge base articles. No more tech support phone calls with people that I can\'t understand due to broken English. No more crowd-sourcing half-hearted "community" answers from people who have little clue about the issue at hand. This is a service he provides WITH the app! <br/><br/>With this tool up and running, I\'m actually EXCITED about marketing again. I don\'t have to dread territory assignment anymore.

Engage is powerful (and customizable!) and is helping my organization gain visibility into who are our most engaged constituents, and who\'s moving up and down. The mechanics of installing the app are fairly quick, but to do so you need to have already defined the engagement levels for your organization. Fortunately, Groundwire provides some helpful documents for how to go about establishing your organization\'s levels of engagement, but it does require your organization to do some strategic thinking if you haven\'t already figured out your engagement pyramid.<br/><br/>What\'s the value of all of this? Well, I just used Engage today to identify a list of fundraising prospects, based on their level of engagement. And this was SO much easier than having to sift through all 100+ of our campaigns! We\'ve only been on Salesforce for about 6 months, so thankfully we don\'t have hundreds or thousands of campaigns to deal with yet. (But if we did, then Engage would have been even more helpful!) By doing all of the calculations in the background, Engage made it easy for me to say, "I want to see all of my constituents at levels 3, 4, and 5" and then to be able to focus my effort on dealing with our most engaged constituents. Of course, you can do more than look at people\'s current levels of engagement, you can also find constituents who have recently climbed or dropped, too.<br/><br/>I haven\'t had an opportunity to use a couple of the other features yet (dashboards and Gratitude Machine), but they look really good. I\'m eager to see how Engage evolves, because it\'s already off to a great start and I was only using the beta version!'}]

It's one thing to just push the customer table to Salesforce. It's another to make sure it syncs to the right accounts. And it's yet another to create sophisticated views of your data (pulling information from several tables) and push them neatly and digested to one object in Salesforce.<br/><br/>The first implementation that we used Commercient was a couple years ago. We integrated Syspro with SQL database with Salesforce, pushing several tables with relevant account info. Mainly invoices, payments, invoice line items, equipment (assets) but also sophisticated SQL views. With further formula fields, this info allowed us to give users a full view of what's going on in each customer. Receivables, average qty sold per week etc.<br/><br/>The sophisticated views looked at recent sales in our database. For every product, it looked up in multiple database tables what was the list price, what price the customer was getting, was that because of a flat contract price or discount %, what effective discount that represented, what discount the customer would be eligible for given their actual volume. And then it presented that data in Salesforce in a single related list.<br/><br/>Note that Commercient can also go beyond the Salesforce integration - as a separate optional service. Once we had it tap into your database, we also wanted to send customers email notifications with their order info. Formatting an HTML email with line item info (i.e. data from child objects) and lots of formula calculations goes beyond what you can do in Salesforce with the built-in email templates. So we worked with Commercient to execute that . As our users put in orders and invoices, customers automagically got email notifications of their orders.<br/><br/>I have worked with part of the Commercient team since 2009 as they were our Syspro reseller. The team and support are solid."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000HqDdIEAV', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000A84NSAAZ', 'reviewer_name': 'Matt Hicks', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Apr 22, 2014 at 12:21 PM', 'review_title': 'Great App and support team', 'review_description': 'The app has helped our company sync our ERP system to salesforce and is helping our business operate more efficiently by allowing the sales team one interface.

I have some customers whom I would love to use S-Drive to send email links to. However, because I can't password protect those links, they refuse to download files using S-Drive links.<br/><br/>2.

S-Drive is a miracle.<br/><br/>The pricing is the best you\'re going to find on the AppExchange as of today. Ease of use for the end users is top-notch and it acts like a native part of Salesforce right out of the "box."<br/><br/>BEST PART: Custom field integration is a total snap. For example, I have a custom picklist on my files identifying which type of document it is (Document A, Document B) and run workflows off this information (e.g. Client XYZ submitted Document A, check!). Just add the custom field per normal to the corresponding custom object (e.g. AccountFile is the default custom object for a file attached to an account), go to the S-Drive Configuration tab, and make it a visible field. BAM.<br/><br/>Documentation is very thorough (and you can read through it before you install). The install PDF looks daunting at first glance, but it\'s a breeze to go through, and if you know how to do basic admin tasks like create a custom object (and/or if you\'re only using this with existing standard objects) then you can skip most sections.<br/><br/>One small comment: You have to follow the "View" page override instructions in the custom object section to get the included standard objects (Account, Opportunity, etc.) to work. I dove right in without reading the instructions, figuring I just had to add a related list, and was wrong.<br/><br/>The only downside is there\'s a couple extra clicks -- I assume there\'s a reason. For example, you have to click "OK" to start selecting files and have to click "Upload" instead of each file uploading as you select it. Really tiny grievance, and I bet there\'s a good reason for it in the background.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000CButcEAD', 'reviewer_id': '00530000004OA27AAG', 'reviewer_name': 'Sunny Singh', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Oct 05, 2011 at 1:43 PM', 'review_title': 'Great tool, beats SFDC limitations!', 'review_description': "We were running into areas where the 5MB attachment was limit was lowering our capacity to work.

If you\'re looking for a perfect reproduction of standard Roll-up Summary fields, you\'ll find a few quirks, but nothing that you can\'t work around with a little know-how (e.g. filters are a little "clunky" compared to standard RUS filters, no "Record Count" summary so you have to create a formula field to Sum). The net-net is still that you get a configurable (i.e. "clicks, not code") method to fill what IMHO is one of the most annoying limitations of Roll-up Summary fields (must be Master-Detail, and can\'t do RUS from Lookups). This App is definitely a winner and I hope they\'ll continue to further enhance it to smooth out the quirks.

If you have custom objects with business data in Salesforce, or if you integrate Salesforce with your back-end ERP/Accounting system, displaying sales data for customers, this is the missing link that allows you to add up all sorts of sales and performance metrics and display them in a field in the account. I.e., Year-to-date sales, year-to-date gross margin, number of event type "customer visit" in the last 12 months, number of support hours left on customer account, total amount of past due invoices etc.<br/><br/>And the summarized field triggers workflows. So if you want an email to be automatically sent to any customers who reach X dollars past due or who run out of pre-paid support hours, the field summarized by this app triggers the workflow for it. Oh yeah.<br/><br/>You may say "Salesforce has a feature that does that - Roll-up summary fields!" But it\'s way too limited: the summaries don\'t work for event/task data, don\'t work for formulas which involve a date variable (i.e., amount of invoices past due, year-to-date opportunity $ closed) and the summarized data doesn\'t trigger workflows.<br/><br/>This app overcomes all those issues.<br/><br/>We installed the free edition right after this app was launched, in September 2012. But had to upgrade to the paid enterprise edition when they capped the data usage in the free edition. If you\'re summing one data field from Cases into Accounts (say support hours used) you\'ll be fine with this version. If however you\'re importing thousands of invoices and hundreds of thousands of invoice line items (in custom objects) and adding them up to hundreds of accounts - well, then you\'ll need the Enterprise edition.<br/><br/>5 stars for the life-changing functionality.

While it does overcome the rollup summary field limit Salesforce imposes, which in itself makes it worthwhile, what makes it invaluable is that it can do so much more than a standard rollup field. The Salesforce admin will no longer be constrained by the source field type – you can do a rollup on other rollups, formula fields, even text fields if you just want a list or subset list to appear on the parent record. And it doesn’t have to be a Master-Detail relationship, it will work on your lookup relationships too. You can use most any field as a criterion to filter your rollup. So for those clicks-vs.-code types out there (like me) and for those who don’t want to spend the time, money, and effort writing code to overcome the Salesforce limits, this app is a must-have.<br/><br/>As for service, the team at Passage Tech is very responsive. If you need help getting started (I’m not suggesting you will; the interface is pretty intuitive), they are just a phone call or email away. For complicated cases, an engineer will help you map it out, build it in your sandbox, and when ready, put through the change set into your production environment.<br/><br/>We tested the free app first, and then quickly migrated to the paid version and put our two rollups into real time – including a text rollup. We then tried our most complex use case (thinking if we can get this one to work, the other 5 cases will be easy). Our use case spanned 6 objects, involved 32 fields, 5 of which were rollup fields for which we used Rollup Helper. It included two custom junction objects, three standard objects, a custom object, formula fields, standard rollup fields, master-detail relationships and lookup relationships – and with some mapping, a couple conversations with an engineer, we tested the result and have it up and running.<br/><br/>For the price, I highly recommend this app for Salesforce admins.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000HbR6LEAV', 'reviewer_id': '00530000007KoDTAA0', 'reviewer_name': 'Mark Miller', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Dec 10, 2012 at 12:15 PM', 'review_title': 'Fills a big gap', 'review_description': 'Rollup fields are a vital feature of Salesforce, but the out of the box field type is limited in a number of ways.

When this transfers to QBB you lose the load number association to the vendor. Its a real mess and one that they "over sold" in terms of capability. There is no training manual, there is no preliminary user set up or documentation for programming. Its basically it breaks, they fix it. We use QBB as our finance system which should be an easy integration. I will tell you it takes about 60 clicks of your mouse to process one invoice through their TMS to ready it for transfer. The back office process is horrible and a definite time suck on the business. Operationally there are benefits to platform, but the back office carrier vetting, docusplit, ZED integration for finance is HORRIBLE. they should just stick to an IIF file for QBB.

What differentiates Mission Control is the people. The level of documentation, support, and engagement is unmatched as it relates to a managed service app. Unless you're a large enterprise organization with a 100+ PMO resources, the typical 'deal size' is in the single or double digits. We have 25-licenses but it feels like - in the service, attention, and communication we get from Mission Control - that we have 500. Not only is the tool intuitive (if you love Salesforce Classic - this is your tool!) but again, the customer support unparalleled. We shopped around for a PM/PMM application and settled on Mission Control for three primary reasons:<br/><br/>1) Customer support<br/>2) User ease of adoption<br/>3) Cost<br/><br/>Your options with this tool are endless and you can capitalize on all the cool functionality of Salesforce (record types, custom fields, workflows, approval processes, and the like) to make it your own. <br/><br/>Highly recommended!

We have since been adding modules one at a time. Currently working on our Audit Module, next will be Training Module which will provide eLearning (Scorm) content to the entire enterprise. We have several more modules to go after this, but i expect it to be as smooth as the first and look forward to our continued work together.<br/><br/>CQ has very highly skilled and knowledgeable people working on our project to make sure we have what we need and when it is needed. CQ is by far one of the best Quality Management Systems i have seen and or worked with. We liked the fact that it allowed for customization and configuration changes, but don't over think any of that. CQ's out of the box solution is great as it is. If your company has never had a Quality Management System, then it would be a good idea to go with their out of the box solution as it is almost perfect, if not perfect. We had a system in place when we purchased CQ so they helped us configure it so our employees understood it easily without to many changes. But most importantly they were able to take all of our data from the old system and pull it into the new system and we kept all of our historical records. They also helped us transfer all of our Historical Training records from 2 other system. At the end of our work together they will also be pulling all of our CAPA and Non Conformance's from yet another system, which i suspect will be an easy task for them.<br/><br/>Honestly i couldn't recommend a better system or a better group of people to work with.

If you can think of a rule based sequence, you can automate a series of emails to match it.<br/><br/>The deal killer for us, and the reason we didn't convert into paying clients, is because we employ Person Accounts within salesforce, which are super common in B2C sales environments, and are sort of a hybrid between a contact and a standard business account. The Makesbridge system only supports emails to Contacts and Leads. Makesbridge doesn't support custom objects, nor person accounts. When I sync up my person accounts lists with Makesbridge, it pulls them in, but it doesn't recognize or import any of the fields that are Person Account specific, so you're unable to base any automation rules off of those fields. I was super disappointed about that. If they ever build in the ability to support Person Accounts, or custom objects, I'll be first in line to sign up.<br/><br/>All that said, I have to give the app 5 stars because it's amazing for what it's built for, Leads and Contacts, I just really wish they can expand the offering a little more so that it will work for our use case. Thank you to the team at Makesbridge for being incredibly helpful and surprisingly nice to work with. If you need to automate email campaigns to Leads or Contacts, then you should get this app today.

But now, I can honestly say that the glowing reviews are spot-on, and my only concern is that they do not do justice in describing the product, support and service Makesbridge provides.<br/><br/>My organization is a small firm, and we were completely priced out of the market for the "standard" automation solutions like Pardot, HubSpot or Marketo. Makesbridge was like a godsend to our team. All of the features we needed, intuitive dashboards and navigation, and beautiful templates. Quite honestly, there is not a single feature that the larger firms have that we could possibly need now that we have implemented Makesbridge- It\'s that good.<br/><br/>The absolute tipping point in satisfaction, however, is the direct result of the incredible support team. Ehsan has provided incredible training, making sure my team understood the application. And if at any point you have questions, or need help, they\'re immediately available. It\'s like having fractional marketing FTE\'s on call. <br/><br/>I\'ve never had such incredible support- Thank you, MakesBridge for making my workload manageable!!!'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000ITqgIEAT', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000B1b7pAAB', 'reviewer_name': 'Mark Hall', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Feb 17, 2015 at 6:55 PM', 'review_title': 'Salesforce is the best tool available', 'review_description': 'Having used Salesforce for a couple years now I have only one comment to make, Get it installed if you want less headaches!!

Viewpath provides all the tasks in a Gantt chart, allowing for quick and easy view of where each tasks lies within the project life span. <br/><br/>I would recommend this program to anyone that is working on projects with other team members or even individually so you can track your tasks and progress. Throw away all of the Excel spreadsheets! Keep all your projects managed in one place, and updated at all times. You don't ever have to worry again if the sheet you are working on is the most current. Even invite people that aren't using Salesforce or Viewpath to view and work on the project.<br/><br/>My one recommendation for Viewpath, and it may be available (still in my first week of using Viewpath), is to be able to link the project to an account in Salesforce. This would create a very powerful user experience.<br/><br/>Thanks for creating such a great tool!"}]

They were very responsive, flexible and terrific to deal with and spent alot of time consulting with me on our pains, challenges and needs - including creating a custom demo.

I can submit an issue and within a short period time, receive communication back and/or the issue resolved.<br/><br/>Keep up the great work.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000J84KVUAZ', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000CTaDyAAL', 'reviewer_name': 'Petra Jennings', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Aug 01, 2016 at 4:38 PM', 'review_title': 'A customer-focused LMS', 'review_description': "We have used NetExam for over 3 years to manage our internal and partner training and certification, including an integration with SFDC. During this time, and especially in the past year, the customer support and engineering teams have been very responsive to fixes and requests. One strength they have that I have not seen in another LMS company, is their closeness with their customers; they genuinely welcome and solicit suggestions for enhancements, and follow through by implementing these enhancements on a regular schedule. <br/><br/>NetExam is committed to growing with our system needs and ever-changing business processes by working closely with us to customize and improve our system. Over the past year, I have worked closely with the NetExam team to develop a Talent Management module in NetExam to manage our internal employees' competencies. Throughout the module development they were responsive, open and creative. <br/><br/>Implementing any hosted LMS system can be time consuming but their very patient project management team supports you all the way with one-on-one training, system examples, templates, and documentation. They are a very approachable and accessible company with an open door policy, which is a rarity in this industry. NetExam has many functionality layers and my only wish would be to have the time to learn about them all so we can implement them! I look forward to many more years working with the NetExam team."}]

Rather than having to do an integration project for each custodian, everything came into the system thru Black Diamond as part of the service. The CRM updates daily just like Black Diamond and we can see Custodian Info, Balances, Households, Portfolios, Holdings, and Accounts. The Elements Integration team was excellent to work with and very responsive. Also, since it is a newer platform they have already implemented some of the feedback that we had to improve the system.

The one big new feature is Einstein Vision (the service itself is free for Salesforce customer to up to 2000 predictions per calendar month). <br/><br/>The complicated thing is to build a model that suits your business. I was really eager to see the Einstein-enabled release of SharinPix, and it actually lived up to the expectation: While Einstein Vision only offers to train a model by pushing things to the API, SharinPix does all of that for you. So with an hour of collecting images, tagging them, you\'re all set. Building the dataset is ridicuously easy (just click "New" in the Dataset related list. And building a model and sending this to the Einstein API is as easy. <br/><br/>So, with less then two hours of work, I had my first Einstein model up and running. SharingPix helps you also to train and refine the model with every prediction. So from my point, that\'s amazing value for customers, both from an SI and an end customer perspective. <br/><br/>I blogged about my first (and fun) model built with SharinPix - even though this was rather a fun project than a business case, you might see the deeper point: You\'ll save a lot of time on building a model, be it for a prototype or a real implementation, and you can do it with zero code, so that all staff can help training the model.

After downloading a trial of SharinPix, we were contacted by the developer who showed us all of the functionality as well as some customization they could do for us so that Sharinpix would meet ALL of our imagery needs. He has been very thorough in his follow up and has taken the time to answer all of our questions. We are currently in the process of having Sharinpix customize the app per our discussions, however using it out-of-the-box in the meantime is already a thousand times better than the previous image solution we were using. I can't wait until our customization is complete, the functionality is going to be awesome!"}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000HzQWUUA3', 'reviewer_id': '0053A00000Cyge9QAB', 'reviewer_name': 'Sarah Persaud', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jan 16, 2017 at 3:15 PM', 'review_title': 'Great App!', 'review_description': "Sharin Pix has been a wonderful implementation to an organization that I work with.

We like that the out-of-the-box tool is already set up to map our basic business processes of intake, assessments, and case records, which would otherwise have to be created from scratch. <br/> <br/>I think the client household model is helpful as well, because we work with families, and Salesforce is not natively set up that way. Reporting has also become a lot more seamless for us.

Most systems don’t have satisfaction that high. <br/><br/>It’s fantastic to have a system that covers over 25 of our programs, and lets us report within and across programs. We can use the framework of ECM but customize it to each of our different services, from health to family services to employment. That was a huge priority for us when selecting a new system. We didn’t want to be tied to something that we couldn’t, to some extent, manage ourselves. The system will never really be “done” – we continue to engage with staff to make it even more useful. Staff have come up with lots of ideas about new features and we can be very responsive. Small changes like a new field or a new option on a picklist can be made very quickly, often within the day. Osborne was one of the first adopters of ECM, so we were able to work with Exponent Partners as they were developing the system. We started implementation about 3 years ago and are using a version that pre-dates the current managed package, but the framework is the same. <br/><br/>The overall ease of use is much higher than with our old system. Entering group services is an area where users have had some difficulties, so we’ve created more user documentation and training around that. Reporting is much simpler and staff are now using real-time, custom dashboards. Direct service staff track their active caseloads and managers see real-time performance dashboards, in ways that weren’t previously possible. The application has changed the way we work -- the assistance with our work process has been very helpful. Staff get reminders of deadlines, milestones, or service follow-ups. They used to track those things in calendars or Excel or other ways that just created more work, but now that kind of tracking is built into our solution. It’s part of why staff really see value in ECM as a tool to help them manage their work.'}]

Without a centralization of leads into a single system, large inside salesforces using WeChat for lead generation are left manually managing hundreds of contacts and WeChat groups - an inefficient and disorganized process.<br/><br/>Beyond just capturing leads in an organized way, Charket has an additional key benefit: it allows us to track the ROI of our QR-code based marketing campaigns. Before Charket, we would send QR codes out into the world and roughly guess how much impact they had. Now we can explicitly measure the number of scans for each code, and measure how many of the leads generated from those scans end up becoming real sales opportunities.<br/><br/>We are only at the beginning of our implementation with Charket and I see some great possibilities. Hope to write an updated review once we've fully deployed it.<br/><br/>If you are a small to medium sized US business in need of advice on using WeChat to sell in China and how Charket could help, I am open to talk.

We incorporated it into multiple sales and operational processes. One example is weekly sales credit: we have filtered views where users can see all their Opportunities which have related submitted Orders for the past week, and enter data on specific product categories for which they are claiming sales credit. A manager then has a separate view where they review the rep submissions for the week, and either approve or disapprove the request. For approved ones, the manager checks a box visible in the view, to indicate these Opportunities are manager reviewed &amp; approved. It takes something that would be highly manual, requiring data entry on multiple pages, and turns it into something where we can do cross-object filtering and multi- or mass-data entry on relevant records.<br/><br/>The tool is incredibly flexible, providing Excel-like functionality, and allowing you to use data on linked records, or to do complex filtering to present just the data that is relevant for the process in question. If you need a field to filter or edit, even on a related object, you can expose it and make it available to the user.<br/><br/>One issue we have had is with Conga's release cycle, where new functions and new look &amp; feel are auto pushed to our organization. This has sometimes required a scramble for users to quickly learn the new considerations with the release as it is in production before they are aware of the changes.<br/><br/>Usage scenarios that we have implemented include:<br/>Weekly sales credit claims/verification<br/>Monthly compliance monitoring process<br/>Timesheet entry using Activities<br/>Operational master data clean up and enhancement processes<br/>On-the-fly cross object reporting<br/>Retention and new sales coaching and reporting<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very useful tool that I would recommend to any administrator.

My users and I were getting frustrated with built in Salesforce functionality, working with a combination of Reports and Views. Reports can't be edited, and Views can only show fields from one object. It's also cumbersome to edit the data in Views, and annoying to change their filter criteria as well. ActionGrid stepped in to save the day. With ActionGrid, you can show data from any related object right next to the object you're looking at. It's super easy to edit a field. There's batch edit too, and lots of cool features. For example, you can export straight from a grid to Excel. No need to go create a report that looks like the view. You can fiter and unfilter, sort and sort again, add columns and remove them, all on the fly.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things is that Grids can be embedded almost anywhere. You can put them on their own tabs, with subtabs so for things you need to access together. You can also put them on any page view. For example, on my Campaign page layout, I have a grid that shows me all the Opportunities that fall in that campaign, with subtabs for different Opportunity Stages. <br/><br/>Their Customer Support is second to none. They are always happy to jump on a call / gotomeeting and figure out exactly how to do what I need.<br/><br/>They are also always coming out with new features, and are very receptive to suggestions. <br/><br/>All in all, I'm very happy with ActionGrid!"}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JUkuqUAD', 'reviewer_id': '0053A00000CMZ5DQAX', 'reviewer_name': 'Johana Palomino', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'May 19, 2016 at 12:16 PM', 'review_title': 'Action Grid - Efficient and easy to use!!', 'review_description': 'Our department has greatly benefited from Action Grid!

Oftentimes we found ourselves wishing there was a way to edit fields all at once on a list of records as if they were an excel spreadsheet. Salesforce in-line editing exists on some views, but only for a few fields.<br/><br/>Enter ActionGrid. <br/><br/>Our outside consultants recommended the tool earlier this year; we haven't looked back. <br/><br/>ActionGrid allows you to: <br/><br/>-Create a grid for all child objects on a particular page layout, edit any field of that object, and quick save all changes all at once! You can also edit childs of those child records, or other related records all from one small grid in the page layout using 'Reading Panes'.<br/><br/>-Create quick data management views and shortcuts to edit revenue forecasts, sales stages, and other important fields for an entire pipeline - all at once! No more opening 10-15 tabs to quickly update 1 field on a list of opportunities. <br/><br/>-Mass-fill and transfer records: you can quickly make the same change across a filtered list of records with just a couple clicks. Transfer owners, update internal team contacts, modify contact roles, modify address information on all contacts for a company move, and more! <br/><br/>-Use conditional formatting within views to point out specific records or areas: we use conditional formatting on 'Last Activity' on all of our contacts to highlight contacts that should be followed up with. <br/><br/>-Build, modify, and export reports on the fly! You can interact with any report as an ActionGrid and export as soon as you've made your changes, all in one screen. <br/><br/>-All fields supported: picklists, multi-picklists, long text, etc.!<br/><br/>All around 100% A+.

Highly recommend ActionGrid!<br/><br/>----<br/>Updated 07.03.2019, my original review was when the app was Action Grid. The app is now owned by Conga and rebranded Conga Grid. <br/><br/>This product is NOT lightning ready as it claims. The only lightning feature available is to provide the option for your grid to have a "Lightning Look", but you cannot actually setup buttons to use the grid with various objects. <br/><br/>The Browse feature is no longer supported and that function was used by our team extensively. It was only after I requested help because it wasn\'t working that I was informed that Conga will no longer support it as the app did when it was Action Grid. We had to purchase another product and pay for custom development to be able to browse multiple records from a grid view.<br/><br/>Support for the grid product is not very good. We began using the product when it was Action Grid and there is an obvious change in product knowledge and support since being purchased by Conga. Conga doesn\'t provide support for custom actions at all for this product, and it is difficult to find knowledgeable help when you encounter a real problem. You have to go through a series of submitting a support case, scheduling a screen share to show your problem to someone, then that person takes the problem higher up and gets back to you (sometimes). It\'s truly disappointing. <br/><br/>The base product still works okay in Classic (allowing 2 stars), that is viewing multiple records in a grid format and doing mass updates.<br/><br/>Considering all SF users will need to eventually transition to lightning, I would not recommend this product.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000IVO3GEAX', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000BMKbqAAH', 'reviewer_name': 'Lindsay Sutula', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jun 17, 2015 at 1:37 PM', 'review_title': 'Drives value for the whole marketing team', 'review_description': "ActionGrid’s segmentation features including grouping, filtering and the amazing Drill Down/Up functions have allowed me to easily create targeted marketing campaigns with just a few clicks.

The User Interface is flexible and clean, one can drag and drop the columns for instance to re-org them.

The support is excellent. The team is using agile to develop, pushing frequent updates and bug fixes, and i value that. The App works in Professional edition and does not require API.<br/><br/>Issues: We run into performance issues which they helped us address in collaboration with the SF support staff. They also made adjustments to a few UI issues along the way. The performance is now adequate.<br/><br/>Area for improvement: i wish one wouldn't have to be in edit mode to do in-line editing (Gridbuddy is good for that).<br/><br/>Overall, an impressive App if you are looking to give your business users a spreadsheet-like experience in Salesforce, with stellar support."}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000IUJ1HEAX', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000AIelCAAT', 'reviewer_name': 'Cassidy Rush', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Mar 26, 2015 at 8:13 AM', 'review_title': 'Very impressive so far', 'review_description': "I'll say that we just got this app into production, but that so far user reaction has been uniformly positive and CRMCulture customer service has been over-the-top outstanding.

On the whole, we’ve found the CIRCE package to be both powerful and easy to use, however, we believe that our organization could have benefited from a higher level of personalized support -- particularly with regards to identifying key areas of work and customizing the CIRCE package to better support the daily workflows of our Resident Services Coordinators. During the initial planning stages of our Salesforce roll-out, we had made a number of requests for minor additions/customizations to be made to the CIRCE package that we felt were necessary for our work; unfortunately those changes were not (and still have not) been implemented. As such, our implementation team has decided to give CIRCE 3/5 stars – while we are starting to see the benefits of switching over to CIRCE, there are still a number of ongoing issues which, we feel, need to be addressed before we’d feel comfortable giving CIRCE a higher score. That being said, we are looking forward to working closer with CIRCE in the future, and are hopeful that we will see some of those requested changes in upcoming releases of the CIRCE package'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JKgdtUAD', 'reviewer_id': '00530000005R2YVAA0', 'reviewer_name': 'R Philip Callahan', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Mar 14, 2017 at 1:11 PM', 'review_title': 'HIPAA Compliant • Massive Productivity Leap • Easy to Adopt', 'review_description': 'The Circe application has proven to be an indispensable productivity addition for our Care Management Services team with the Laguna Beach Seniors.

All extraneous documents pertaining to each client can also be uploaded and accessed from the Program Chart, reducing the risk of lost files and client data.<br/><br/>The flexibility of Circe has allowed us to customize the application specific to our organizational needs and provides us with relevant, meaningful reports. And with the Circe application implemented, our organization has been able to go paperless! Not only can we access records when in the field; it also allows Care Managers to assist clients more efficiently when the assigned care manager is unavailable, ensuring continuity of care.<br/><br/>Another nice feature is the forgiving nature of the CIRCE application, which allows us to quickly find and fix data input errors all while keeping record of the edit for compliance.<br/><br/>In short, this Care Management System makes us more efficient and reliable as well as HIPAA compliant, mobile and paperless.

InsightSquared does a lot of great things that I personally haven't seen other analytics companies do.

It is very intuitive and easy to use and navigate. There are many reports already created in the system that are beneficial so once you are up and running you already of many reports created for you to use and analyze at your disposal. Dashboards are easy to create and many templates readily available to make it even easier. There's much to like about this product and company.<br/><br/>Customization and custom reports have been the only challenge for our business. Outside of their pre-built reports, custom reports are very limited and if your business has a unique way of looking at certain data points or you have a report that is more advanced looking at multiple pieces of data you may have a hard time implementing these into Insightsquared. That being said their support and customer happiness team are available for calls and discussions to help get you what you need.

You can see trends by rep for pipeline and closed deals. You can see trends by custom fields like industry category as well. Their monthly and quarterly forecasting works very well and is a good view of your future potential. Installation is a snap. They send you an email, you click on it, then a day later your account is provisioned. Nothing could be easier. Finally, it is cost effective. They only bill you for the user licenses that put data into the system. So if you have 20 sellers carrying a book, you pay for 20 licenses. You need to have access for 50 people?

I have just worked with an organization that used the BRICKWORK integration with Groundwire's Auctions for Salesforce package to manage payments for their annual fundraiser auction. We validated guests' credit cards as they arrived at the event, using the CheckIn tab in GW Auctions and charged some of the cards as requested by guests at the end of the evening with the Check Out tab. It all worked seamlessly for the processing, and having card swipe readers saved a lot of time and effort. <br/><br/>I appreciate the elegance and flexibility of the IATS solution for Salesforce. An IATS Transaction record can be related to a Contact, an Account and/or an Opportunity, which gives the full range of options for creating the payment. For example, with the auction, the Transaction represented several Opportunities, so was related to the Contact only. But we have also used IATS for recurring donations, where the original pledge is the Opportunity record, and each installment is represented by a related Transaction. The overnight Journal Sync is another excellent feature - pulling the recurring payments from the IATS servers and adding them to the Opportunity record without any extra effort from us.<br/><br/>IATS Customer Support is also responsive and friendly - I've enjoyed working with their team to solve problems and to get the additional features added when they are needed.

Now, with IATS Brickwork, the data is automatically entered into Salesforce when a donation comes through (saving so much time on data entry), and the online donations are deposited directly into our bank account.<br/> <br/>IATS customer support and service has been excellent-- incredibly responsive and helpful. It has always been easy to reach a knowledgeable employee, who is there to guide you through your questions, and troubleshoot as needed. We recently ran a Mothers' Day fundraising campaign, and IATS Brickwork was essential in the incredible success of the campaign, and our team's ability to respond effectively to the over 1,900 donations we received in the span of three days. The AURA donation page encouraged these donations, and we were able to raise 14x more in donations than we were expecting. All in all, everyone we've worked with at IATS has provided outstanding customer support.<br/><br/>They are currently working on developing an automated email message/receipt for donations, which will be an added improvement on an already great application."}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000004WAxwEAG', 'reviewer_id': '005300000047PyBAAU', 'reviewer_name': 'Katy Mathias', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Mar 23, 2011 at 4:51 PM', 'review_title': 'Life-altering tool for a small nonprofit', 'review_description': "We are in love with IATS! This is one of those products that you don't even realize how much you need, until you find out it exists. Excellent integration with Salesforce. Cost-effective web-based donations processing. Reduced time spent duplicating data entry. <br/><br/>We were experiencing several challenges. First, processing credit card donations was a time-consuming process, involving a lot of repeated data entry. We now process credit cards directly in Salesforce, which has completely streamlined the process. This has enabled us to cancel our merchant services account with our bank and rely solely on IATS for credit card processing. <br/><br/>Second, we had no convenient way to automate recurring gifts. Now, our monthly pledges are processed automatically, and I'm told IATS is working on an upgrade that will allow us to do the same with annual pledges.<br/><br/>Third, we were paying a lot of money in Paypal processing fees for online donations, and had a fairly clunky interface. And, this resulted in a time-consuming series of processes because we had to re-key the donor information into Salesforce, and manually transfer the funds from Paypal to our bank account. When we shopped around, we found most options were either very expensive, or were going to require a lot of customization to create a donor interface. With IATS (and some very cost-effective custom web design by Idealist Consulting), we now have a secure online donor page which (a) puts the funds directly into our checking account and (b) puts the donor information directly into Salesforce.<br/><br/>On the whole, we are thrilled.<br/><br/>Katy Mathias, Salish Sea Expeditions"}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000001qlyNEAQ', 'reviewer_id': '00530000001sIpLAAU', 'reviewer_name': 'SF Admin', 'rating_stars': '40', 'review_date': 'Jul 30, 2010 at 12:30 PM', 'review_title': 'Terrific Company – Great App', 'review_description': 'When we were in the process of converting from Etapestry to Salesforce we looked at what we liked about Etapestry. One of these items was its integration with IATS. For non-profits such as ours, IATS is the only way to go. They are reliable, their fee per transaction is the lowest in the industry, and throughout our time with them there have been no problems whatsoever. How many vendors can you say that about?<br/><br/>I contacted IATS to see if they had any integration with Salesforce. At the time they did not, but they were working on an App. We felt so strongly about IATS as a company we decided to wait for their App to be completed as opposed to switching to another payment processor that had integration with Salesforce. It was worth the wait.<br/><br/>While this app is not EVERYTHING I want it to be yet, I have no doubt it will be soon. Here is what it can do for you:<br/>1) Allows you to run your own credit cards from within Salesforce at the Account, Contact, or Opportunity Level.<br/>2) The way the app is configured allows you to integrate it with every flavor of Salesforce you might have including Person Accounts, the non-profit starter pack, the standard Salesforce configuration, and even our own unique configuration of Opportunity in which we have created a Transaction related object to handle payments made in an Opportunity (pledges, down payments/final payments, etc)<br/>3) IATS gives you the html code so you can configure your own online donation page. If you have ever worked with web-to-lead webpage setup, it is not different from this. Once the online donation is submitted, an Opportunity is automatically created. From there you link your opportunity to the appropriate account and/or contact using lookup fields.<br/>4) I suspect it would be advantageous for any non-profit to acquire this app now and be a part of the continual upgrades that will be made to this App. They have already made improvements based on a number of my suggestions.'}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000001qhR4EAI', 'reviewer_id': '00530000003HzhpAAC', 'reviewer_name': 'Alvino Villa', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Jul 19, 2010 at 11:37 AM', 'review_title': 'Great processing tool!', 'review_description': 'This app seamlessly adds credit card processing capabilities.

Taskfeed has solved all these issues for us - as it's so easy to use, they just have to log into Salesforce and drag and drop the activities that have been completed. Everyone in the team has visibility of this so the sales team are always aware of the progress from the tech team. With External sharing, we successfully manage expectations by showing customers from the beginning the plan for the deployment or PoC. As Taskfeed is very flexible, we can customise our usual templates to fit the customer's needs if necessary. We have also created processes to update our Salesforce records when activities are marked as completed in Taskfeed which allows us to have better visibility and report back to management; and because Taskfeed is so quick to use there are no more problems with people not keeping up with their admin.

It includes all of the core capabilities any service or maintenance organization requires, from service call management, to technician scheduling, to contracts and warranties, to service parts inventory control, to depot repair, and much more.
