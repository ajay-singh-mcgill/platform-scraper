I sent an email 4 days ago, which makes me worry about support... (that was one of the stars)<br/><br/>I'm evaluating this for a client, and I have to say, its a nice model and seems to work.<br/>I'd like to be able to automate the syncing, and move stats back to the Campaign Member object.<br/>That way you can run a manual user journey kind of campaign. (that was the other star)<br/><br/>And the videos need some serious re-editing!"}, {'review_id': 'a0S3A00000JKJ6kUAH', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000BnZTKAA3', 'reviewer_name': 'Juan Maart', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Sep 08, 2016 at 7:27 PM', 'review_title': 'Great support experience', 'review_description': "We had an issue last night Sydney time and within an hour Stane had looked into it and it was resolved.

I\'m not sure this is the best venue for this comment, but for a company that prides itself on its "Awesome support" and given all the rave support reviews, I\'m a little surprised that I haven\'t gotten even an initial a response from ChimpSync. I\'ve sent two queries out to them over the past week, both of which are related to how unsubscribe, resubscribe, and subscribe works and syncs between the two tools, via ChimpSync. Since I really need to make a recommendation to my client, I decided to go ahead and sign up for the free trial despite not having answers to my questions. <br/><br/>Now I\'m trying to follow the setup videos and am further stuck. For example (really, this just one example... I really need a lot more help than this), in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKOQX63ekJU) the guy says "First I have to select appropriate MailChimp list, so I\'ll go here and use test". Well, when I click "MailChimp List" there are no lists listed. I have lists set up in MailChimp, so what am I doing wrong? Why aren\'t the lists appearing?<br/><br/>Does anybody know of any tutorial videos that really show you how to set up BOTH MailChimp AND ChimpSync, together, from scratch? Our Salesforce is thoroughly setup already, but I\'ve never used either of these tools, and I think the ChimpSync tutorial videos assume that I\'ve already done a bunch of MailChimp setup. With that in mind, I tried following some MailChimp setup videos but I can tell right from the get-go that some of the setup there will be different given the Salesforce integration with ChimpSync.<br/><br/>I would really appreciate anything anybody\'s got out there to help me get rolling with this stuff, so that my client can make a decision as to whether or not they even want to go with MailChimp and ChimpSync as their mass email tool, in the first place.<br/><br/>Thanks!'}, {'review_id': 'a0S3000000IUxiHEAT', 'reviewer_id': '0053000000AKdSuAAL', 'reviewer_name': 'Cindy Kester', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'May 15, 2015 at 9:19 AM', 'review_title': 'Great app', 'review_description': 'I have tested a few apps to sync between Salesforce and MailChimp.

When SF is planned to be the leading system, it is a must have to be able to report "erverything" within salesforce. Choosing MailChimp as a good solution for our newsletters there was a gap! Getting data back from MailChimp into SF with the standard-tool is not possible.<br/>Then we found ChimpSync! There\'s no way around this solution, if you are using SF and MaliChimp ChimpSync is a must-have! After having done the setup there was a problem by running the synchronization, which was at this time also not known by the provider. We got into contact by email and received answers very quick, but the problem wasn\'t solved - so the next morning we met in a web-meeting and together analyzed what was not working - absolut amazing contact and support! :-)'}, {'review_id': 'a0S30000000fCMZEA2', 'reviewer_id': '00530000006dxhtAAA', 'reviewer_name': 'Christer Sjöberg', 'rating_stars': '50', 'review_date': 'Nov 05, 2014 at 9:45 AM', 'review_title': 'Works like a charm - to a very competitive price', 'review_description': 'We are still learning how to use Campaigns and Mailchimp with the ChimpSync bridge.

Incredible Customer Support', 'review_description': "We use the non-profit SF package and our Mailchimp list is very, very segmented. We have been searching for the right tool to help us integrate our contacts from SF in a meaningful way. As far as I am concerned, this is the only legitimate solution on the exchange right now that can handle a functional and customizable solution for integrating SF to MC. And the customer service is incredible. Timely response to emails, phone calls that reach actual people, and in-depth knowledge of the product to be able to customize for your every need. <br/><br/>With ChimpSync, our MailChimp segmentation is now as powerful and sophisticated as the reporting tool in SalesForce - because it is directly connected. I can pull any report, and with the click of a button create a segmented campaign ready to edit and send to my donors/customers. And all the data collected by mailchimp, such as what was opened and clicked, is synced right back to my contact records.<br/><br/>Can't recommend it highly enough!"}]
