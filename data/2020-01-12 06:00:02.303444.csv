The Peer Group Financial Analytics software allows analysts to cross-compare the selected company against the selected peer group for an identified group of ratios. This facilitates the user to detect the best and worst performing companies within the financial parametric head. It measures the ratios against a set institutional bench mark (Standard Deviation) or an Industry Average. Any positive (green) or negative deviation (red) from the set bench mark sets off an alert trigger. The analyst can view the results in tabular or graphical form. The latter allows the analysts to view industry trends or deviations at a glance without going through rows of numbers. This allows the analysts to zero in on a company which is not in line with the industry trend. Based on the selected ratios it selects the “best in class” company within the selected peer group and ranks the companies accordingly.            ~['Professional &amp; Up', 'No Limits']~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~None~NA~['English']~NA~NA~NA~NA~ARX Analytics &amp; Advisory Pvt Ltd.~NA~None

Hit the ground running with the Loader by updating years of historical exchange rates in seconds.                One of the major problems with forecasting revenues is caused by opportunities being transacted in different currencies. Salesforce lets you set up and manage currencies for your organisation so that you can see the “converted amount” for the opportunity in your own currency. But where do these rates come from? Until now they had to be updated by your system administrator by looking at exchange rate websites and updating the currencies manually. Now these rates can be fed directly from multiple data sources into your Salesforce account so your forecast revenues reflect the current exchange rate. There is no room for typing errors or inaccurate rates.            ~['Lightning Ready', 'Enterprise &amp; Up', 'No Limits', 'Multi-Currency']~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~None~NA~['English']~NA~NA~NA~NA~Bringing Solutions Ltd~NA~None
