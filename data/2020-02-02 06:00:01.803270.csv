Led by a commitment to bring digital era skills to more than a million people, the company’s enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) platform has already automated millions of repetitive, mind-numbing tasks for business and government organizations all over the world, improving productivity, customer experience, and employee job satisfaction.            ~['Lightning Ready', 'Professional &amp; Up', 'No Limits']~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~None~NA~['English']~NA~NA~NA~NA~UiPath Inc.~NA~What is Robotic Process Automation?##Robotic Process Automation is the technology that allows anyone today to configure computer software, or a “robot” to emulate and integrate the actions of a human interacting within digital systems to execute a business process. RPA robots utilize the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications just like humans do. They interpret, trigger responses and communicate with other systems in order to perform on a vast variety of repetitive tasks. Only substantially better: an RPA software robot never sleeps, makes zero mistakes and costs a lot less than an employee.##How is RPA different from other enterprise automation tools? In contrast to other, traditional IT solutions, RPA allows organizations to automate at a fraction of the cost and time previously encountered. RPA is also non-intrusive in nature and leverages the existing infrastructure without causing disruption to underlying systems, which would be difficult and costly to replace. With RPA, cost efficiency and compliance are no longer an operating cost but a byproduct of the automation.

The app determines how long it takes sales reps to log activities, tasks or events after a lead assignment.

CareService Connect - Bridge Connector - AppExchange~a0N3A00000FMWVTUA5~https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FMWVTUA5~Starting at $750 USD per company per year~0~None~9/25/2019~~Productivity~ Customers are often frustrated by the lack of options that address Social Determinants for their patients. From one streamlined platform on Salesforce, care providers can now pair Barriers with Interventions and track to completion.~68% of patients suffer from at least one social determinant of health, which Salesforce helps to identify.CareService Connect makes these barriers to care actionable to end users by providing “Interventions,” or programs offered by social services agencies, searchable by a patient’s zip code. Referrals are seamlessly contacted on the patient’s behalf.Closed-loop functionality allows referrals to be tracked to completion, mitigating the effect of these social barriers on patients’ health outcomes.                CareService Connect is a Salesforce Application that provides social workers as well as other healthcare professionals with solutions for their patients who are experiencing a barrier to care or social determinant of health. CareService Connect can mitigate the adversity patients face in each of these areas — care, education, emergency, food, goods, health, housing, money, transit, work — which impedes them from receiving medical treatments they need. The app resides in Salesforce and jettisons the silo experienced between barriers to care and the end user’s need to provide solutions via referrals to social services agencies. Searchable by patient zip code, referrals are populated, selected, then contacted on the patient’s behalf. The app can also track outcomes from those referrals, thus lowering a patient's risk score which might have previously been thwarted by these "barriers to care," and improving outcomes for some of the most marginalized patient populations. End users are empowered to not identify barriers to care for their patients, but can now also refer and track solutions to completion — all natively within Salesforce.            ~['Lightning Ready', 'Professional &amp; Up', 'No Limits', 'Person Accounts']~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~None~NA~['English']~NA~NA~NA~NA~Bridge Connector~NA~Bridge Connector is a data-driven workflow automation platform changing the way healthcare communicates.

With this app, get an email notification of the meeting request response.~Get email notification of Meeting Request ResponseReport on Event Meeting Request ResponsesSolve the missing feature of Salesforce!                Salesforce Events allows you add multiple contacts and users to an event and then send an invite to them.  They receive an email like an Outlook meeting request with a button to click so that they can respond to the meeting request.  They can submit their response as Accepted or Declined.  That information is updated on the Event record in Salesforce, but you don't get notified via email!  So in order to check the response of the meeting request you have to go back to the Event record manually and check the status.  Could be a very time consuming and in-efficient task sometimes rendering this whole feature useless.  Install this app and the owner of the Event gets notified via their user email when a User or Contact or Lead responds to the meeting request you sent with an email with the detail of the Event and the response.  Now you know right away if they accepted or declined.  The email notification checks for new responses every 15 minutes, so that is the max delay to being notified of the response.  With this app you can also create custom Reports to report on and create Dashboards on the Meeting Attendee object.  Currently this info is not available to reports or data export.            ~['Lightning Ready', 'Enterprise &amp; Up', 'No Limits']~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~None~NA~['English']~NA~NA~NA~NA~A5 Apps (Previously Ramsey Solutions)~NA~With 10 years of Salesforce consulting experience and over 800 projects we identify gaps in the Salesforce marketplace where we can provide apps that don't exist or build something better than the competitors.

Salesforce is increasingly acting as an abstract customer lifecycle and interaction layer that sits above traditional transactional systems.####Every person that touches the customer along their lifecycle should be a participant on a common, customer-centric platform.  The more participants on the platform, the richer and more actionable the customer information, the more power the company has to innovate new ways to leverage that information to transform the customer experience.  Customer satisfaction is higher when the customer does not need to repeat themselves across channels.  The value of each customer interaction is higher.####The use of a timeline is a tremendously powerful way to show interactions and events across the dimension of time, where the most recent event is clearly visible, no matter what type of object it is or which related list it comes from.  When engaging with a customer, that level of visibility dramatically shortens the amount of time to begin the conversation, reduces repetition and handle time, and makes cross-channel interactions more seamless.            ~['Lightning Ready', 'Enterprise &amp; Up', 'No Limits']~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~NA~None~NA~['English']~NA~NA~NA~NA~Salesforce Labs~NA~Salesforce Labs is a program that lets salesforce.com engineers, professional services staff and other employees share AppExchange apps they've created with the customer community.
