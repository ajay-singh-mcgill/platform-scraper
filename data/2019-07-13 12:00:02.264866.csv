Hit the ground running with the Loader by updating up to two years of historical exchange rates in seconds.                One of the major problems with forecasting revenues is caused by opportunities being transacted in different currencies. Salesforce lets you set up and manage currencies for your organisation so that you can see the “converted amount” for the opportunity in your own currency. But where do these rates come from? Until now they had to be updated by your system administrator by looking at exchange rate websites and updating the currencies manually. Now these rates can be fed directly from multiple data sources into your Salesforce account so your forecast revenues reflect the current exchange rate. There is no room for typing errors or inaccurate rates.            ~['Lightning Ready', 'Enterprise &amp; Up', 'No Limits', 'Multi-Currency']~ 12~ 3~ 2~ 7~ 0~ 0~Enterprise,Unlimited,Developer,Performance~*Admin users only##Advanced Currency Management~None~NA~['English']~~NA~NA~NA~Bringing Solutions Ltd~NA~None
