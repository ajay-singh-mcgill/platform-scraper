IXUP also incorporates the Five Safes framework allowing clients to assign precisely the level of security control they want for each of the five safes (namely projects, people, settings, data and output) .IXUP provides an easy to use, drag-and-drop interface to work on data modelling and computations over encrypted data (including AES 256 and homomorphic MS Seal). IXUP’s smart matching technology (exact, probabilistic and geo) then identifies matches in the encrypted data to expose secure insights.IXUP’s product also offers direct connectivity to all major data warehouses (Azure Data Warehouse, Snowflake, RedShift, BigQuery) and business intelligence tools (including Power BI and Tableau) to work/report on the results of any computation, as permissioned by the data owners.IXUP’s unique approach solves the problems associated with traditional data sharing techniques.

The out of the box functionality to Connect to Outlook only works with, as the name implies, Microsoft Outlook. XSPECTS has a solution to allow you to subscribe to your SharePoint calendars from iCal compatible devices and devices that use the Google Calendar app.  It adds a new menu group to the ribbon for all Calendars in your SharePoint site - once clicked the App creates a Calendar feed file (.ics file) in the iCal format.  This Calendar feed ics file is stored via a public URL.You can either click the link generated to automatically Subscribe to the feed (if you are browsing your SharePoint site with your mobile device), or you can manually Subscribe to the Calendar Feed using the link provided.The Calendar Feed URL can be shared with all of your users via email or by posting the Calendar Feed URL on your site - because the feed is stored on a public URL even people who do not have accounts to browse to your SharePoint site can use the URL to Subscribe to your Calendar Feed!Will the iCal Calendar Feed file always be available?  Yes!  The Calendar Feed file is stored using Windows Azure Blob Storage with server redundancy, so even if your SharePoint site goes down the feed will still be available.Will the iCal Calendar Feed file be updated with calendar events added after I subscribe?Yes!  The Calendar Feed file is updated every time someone else subscribes, and it is also updated whenever a new event is added, deleted or updated on a calendar that has been previously subscribed to.How much does the iCal Calendar Feed App cost?The App costs $49.00 per month on a subscription basis.  Only 1 license is needed for your site, there is no per user licensing fee and even people without an Office 365 account can access the feed after it has been generated by a user on your site.Is there a Trial version?Yes!  A 15 day trial is available so you can test the AppHow does it work?When the Generate iCal Link icon is clicked the App reads through all event items in the Calendar and writes out a text file with a .ics extension listing your events in the iCal format.  This ics file is then written out to Windows Azure Blob Storage and a public link to the file is displayed to the user.  Anytime the calendar is updated a remote event receiver is triggered re-writing and re-publishing the .ics iCal file, ensuring the feed is always up to date.Does the iCal Feed Generator handle recurring events?Yes!  The iCal Feed Generator creates recurring events in the ics file in accordance with the iCal formatDoes the iCal Feed Generator work for iPhones, iPads and MACs?Yes!

The premise for this is personalized information and possibility of communication.Using Microsoft Azure and Cognitive Services, the platform will personalize information to the individual's intellectual level.AudienceThe primary audience is children and youth with intellectual disabilities and others in need of alternative and supplementary communication.Why Leisure ActivitiesThe platform is used for sharing <b>personalized information</b> about <b>special leisure activities</b>. Organisers reach more people with better information about their offerings, and with peronalized information, the audience can take a more <b>active part in their own lives</b>. Better information to more people lowers the threshold to participation in leisure activities.Examples of personalization are text simplification (easy-to-read text), replacement of text with images, video or symbols, as well as text-to-speech and language translation.Leisure activities are a <b>major area</b> for learning, development and social contact for all, and people with disabilities in particular. Many leisure activities give <b>health benefits</b>.Platform AccessPlatform access is provided via an organiser web portal for information entry, a personalized end-user app for information retrieval, and an API for integration from other vendors.Picture Communication SymbolsThe platform includes Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) provided by <b>Tobii Dynavox</b>, our preferred technology content partner.PersonalizationAccess to app functions and information is individually defined per user. Examples of personal settings are:<ul><li>information level (full text, easy-to-read text, no text)</li><li>preferred language</li><li>symbol display (on/off), can be combined with text</li><li>automatic text-to-speech (on/off)</li><li>number of days ahead visible in the activity calendar</li><li>my groups, ie which activities I participate in or are interested in. Events for my groups are automatically displayed in my activity calendar.</li></ul>SearchesAll activities are classified into <b>type of disability</b>. With the app one can thus search for activities for e.g. people with intellectual disabilities, visual impairment or hearing impairment.It is also possible to search for <b>type of activity</b> (outdoor activities, football, riding, singing, dancing, and a lot of other activities) as well as any offers within a <b>municipality</b> or a <b>county</b>.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/smartcognitionas.active_leisure?tab=Overview~smartcognitionas.active_leisure

[]~['Teams']~['Collaboration', 'Human resources', 'Social']~Microsoft Corporation~1.2.1~3/12/2019~Yammer for Teams~1~5.0 ~Empower engagement and collaboration in your organization through conversations and communities.~Bring the power of Yammer to Microsoft Teams and simplify, optimize, and control your communication workflow. Together, Yammer and Teams create new levels of efficiency to get the right information to the right people at the right time. Move broader Yammer conversations to a limited audience for follow ups, discussions, and alignment. Or team members can participate in a Yammer conversation from Teams before posting to a Yammer group. Ways to use Yammer in Teams include organizational changes, event production, software roll outs, and much more. Organizational ChangesOften there are large organizational changes announced to the company. Some companies create groups around those changes, for example an HR Benefits Group when new benefits packages are announced, or Open Enrollment occurs. A Yammer group for employees’ questions would be a place to post and get answers, or to point people to previously answered questions. These questions and answers are helpful to create additional content for FAQs.Sample Groups: HR Benefits Team, Merger &amp; Acquisitions, Leadership ConnectionEvent Production If an event is hosted LIVE or a YamJam in Yammer, you can use both Teams and Yammer together for the best experience for your audience. Some organizations have Yammer groups for each event while other customers have departmental groups and host multiple events within that group.  While the event is going on, there may be a question or comment that needs further discussion with the event team before its answered, either ON AIR or in Yammer. The team can discuss amongst themselves and get back to the original question quickly with an answer. Using Teams provides a backchannel for the event team to coordinate prior to a response.Sample Groups: Leadership Connection, Innovation YamJam, Sales Quarterly ReviewsSoftware Rollout Projects   When new software rolls out to your organization, change can be hard. Employees have questions about efficiency and productivity. IT Project teams have been successful in creating self-help Yammer communities to support these rollouts and changes. Yet when issues and concerns or product improvement are shared, the IT Project team needs a place to converse and determine what should be shared and posted to the wider community. Having an IT Project Core Team channel creates a place for the group to discuss an upcoming outage or an unplanned issue before alerting employees.Sample Groups: New to Office365, CRM Dynamics UsersMarketing and Sales – using a Yammer #topicCustomer facing teams need to stay in the loop about the competition, and yet they may not know of how marketing or the organization is helping prepare for the competition. When the competition is brought up on the Yammer network, the marketing team can keep a pulse without having to be part of every group or conversation on Yammer. The Marketing Team can have the Yammer Tab in Teams set to follow a specific hashtag, like the competitors name. When the hashtag is used in the Yammer network, the tab is populated to start the conversation in the Team channel. The marketing team can easily follow up with specific tactics, content or additional questions in relation to the competitor.

['Professional services']~['Dynamics 365 Sales']~['Collaboration', 'Productivity']~PrenticeWorx llc~2.0~NA~Curo365~0~NA~Law Firm Practice Management Software~<b>Product Vision</b>The developers behind Curo365 interviewed numerous attorneys to better understand the technologies they are using and where those solutions fall short. What was found was that law firms generally utilize four primary technology components to manage their operations, these components include: (i) Case/Matter Management; (ii) Document Management; (ii) Communications and Calendaring; and (iv) a Financial/ERP system. However, of the lawyers interviewed not a single firm was utilizing a practice management solution that contained all four components. The vision for Curo365 is to provide a single robust solution to optimally handle all of the technology needs within a law firm, which solution will allow those organizations to obtain better transparency into every level of their business and thereby dramatically increase profitability through efficiency and strategy.<b>Curo365 Key Features</b><b>Task Management</b>: Curo365 utilizes its own proprietary tasking system, in conjunction with the tools native to Microsoft Office, to ensure that every instruction disseminated or received by a member of the firm, and the action associated with the instruction has a corresponding time entry that can be billed.<b>Time Tracking</b>: Time tracking (billing) is standard with any practice management solution. However, the way Curo365 facilitates time tracking enables users to be dramatically more efficient and productive.<b>Email</b>: Curo365 has the ability to track all emails and connect them to the relevant records within Curo365. These functions are fully integrated with Exchange and Outlook.<b>Calendaring</b>: Any appointments created in Curo365 will be synchronized with Exchange and display on a user’s Outlook calendar. Each appointment within a practice group can also show up in an Exchange group calendar, which feature allows practice leaders with better insight into each of their attorney’s schedules.<b>Invoicing</b>: Curo365 is setup to invoice all customers with outstanding billings based on designated time period, and to remind customers via a “statement” about amounts due and owing. The invoices can be sent as a PDF attached to an email or sent to a printer queue, based on each customer’s preference.<b>Accounting</b>: All of a law firm’s deposits, payments, costs, billings, and transfers are entered into Curo365. This ensures that key employees have instant and meaningful insights into the current financial status of every aspect of the firm.<b>Reports</b>: Curo365’s reporting functionality is second to none in that all data within Curo365 is available to generate reports and to instantly visualize the data using the “charts” features. Each user has access to a robust set of native reports, but Curo365 is also able to create custom reports specific to the needs of each law firm.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/prenticeworx.curo365?tab=Overview~prenticeworx.curo365
