Clustering helps you find similarity groups in your data and it is one of the most common tasks in the Data Science. Finding the "outliers", which are the observations in your data isolated from the rest of observations, is often a non-easy analytics task by its own.

You can control the algorithm parameters and the visual attributes to suit your needs.

When you put Gantt chart along with other insightful charts in an interactive canvas, you can manage your project in whole new way. In Power BI as visuals interact with each other, you can look at your resource allocation, task completion, remaining tasks in different perspective and get a firm handle on the future.Gantt charts are indispensable part of project management portfolio. Project Managers and executives love Gantt charts, since they visually show in a very effective at-a-glance way, the overall time line of the project, the current status &amp; progress (or lack thereof) along with the assignment at considerable details.With this custom visual, you can specify the Tasks, Start Date, Duration and %Completion for rendering them as Gantt. Please note that the %Completion expects a decimal value ( for example 0.85 means  85%) and Start Date , a date field and not a date hierarchy.You can also control the color of the bar with a Legend. You can use any relevant field from your project as Legend for example task type for this purpose. Additionally, you can also specify the resource field, which would be listed next the bar in the Gantt.This is an open source visual.

Any change, e.g. a postponed delivery date for a purchase order, will immediately (real-time) cause a re-allocation of sales orders thus generating a new optimal allocation picture. All together this will ensure optimal fulfillment of as many sales orders as possible and the lowest possible inventory levels at any point in time.Visual overview of the allocation for complete sales ordersThe optimal ATP calculation is performed real-time for all open sales orders and the result is visualized using ”traffic light colors” directly in the sales order screen. In milliseconds you can, through the color recognition of the human eye, get an overview of the delivery capability for complete sales orders: Red is bad, while Yellow and Green is good.Traffic light allocation centerA red sales order line always means a disappointed customer who cannot get his goods on time, so any red order line must be dealt with to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. The well-featured Traffic light allocation center provides an overview of delivery options and provides tools to adjust delivery dates, reprioritize or manipulate so that no red order line / customer is left without attention.Time fence controlled reservationPhysical reservations are only used to signal that the picking process can be initiated as the actual allocation is performed when the sales order lines are entered and following upon any change among the expected receipts or on-hand levels. The physical reservations are established by a background process using a time fence controlled approach so that physical reservations first kick in very close to the picking process need to be started.Smart Reservation is developed in collaboration with Abena, Svendsen Sport, Trespass, Dr. Martens and Rosendahl Design Group.Per Munk Nielsen (Logistics Director at Rosendahl) says: "I have as responsible for the logistics department for years spent a lot of time re-arranging reservations to ensure that my customers receive their goods on time, these days are over after we got Smart Reservation.

With only a few mouse clicks, process mining can uncover hidden information about the processes and generate new insights. Process mining is based on event data. Event data can be anything that has a discrete time connected to it, that is, one can determine when something has happened. This is essential to model causality. Now, we must define what has happened. In most cases, this is trivial because the software saves the data accordingly. The last step is to combine multiple events into coherent business cases. All that is needed is a connection between the events. This can be, for instance, an invoice number, which connects all events in which this invoice is handled.When contemplating process mining, you should ask yourself 4 simple questions. <ul><li> Are the events of my process saved somewhere? </li></ul><ul><li> Is a time connected to these events? </li></ul><ul><li> Can I connect multiple events to form coherent cases? </li></ul><ul><li> Are cases comparable, that is, do all cases represent the same process? </li></ul> If you can answer all those questions with yes – and most people can – you are good to go. The classic data format for process mining is an event log. An event log holds exactly the three types of information mentioned earlier. You need a Case Id to uniquely identify cases, an Activity Name describing what has happened, and, finally, a Timestamp to denote when something has happened. If you provide an event log including these necessary fields, you can start with PAFnow Process Mining right away. Unleash the power of process mining and get n-times better today.More about PAFnow: pafnow.com/power-bi~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can read and make changes to your document</li><li>Can send data over the Internet</li>~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA200000072?tab=Overview~WA200000072

Natural Language Processing is a tool used to read, understand, and extract human language in a manner which is valuable. SyTrue’s Natural Language Processing OS™is an NLP-based platform for the medical community.The NLP OS™ uses its library of medical data models, medical terminology dictionaries, and machine learning models in order to consume, read and extract valuable insights specifically from medical text. The platform is designed to interact with both unstructured documents (i.e. constructed in the medium of natural human language) and structured (i.e. machine-readable) documents.Healthcare’s most advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) Operating System, NLP OS™ – this is what healthcare has needed!Empower Your Team. Generate Informative Content. Go Enterprise-wide!NLP OS™ cascades a single medical record into multi-purpose content in less than a second. Want to know which ICD-10, CPT, LOINC, SNOMED, HCC codes are represented within the same medical record? That’s easy. Need to identify allergies, medications, hedging terms or critical findings? Yep… What about personal history, medical necessity, pain or inference? SyTrue’s clinical analyzers dive deep into the content contained within medical records shedding valuable insights on the patients’ encounter. One medical record – multiple purposes.Obtain. Process. Share.Regardless if you’ve been in healthcare for one year or 30 years you understand obtaining medical record data from a single healthcare facility, let alone multiple facilities, can be difficult! Our enterprise-wide platform addresses unstructured data regardless of format. SyTrue’s technology pipeline enables health plans and providers to obtain data through multiple means – OCR, API, HL7, etc. Once the medical records have been ingested SyTrue’s NLP OS reads through the medical records identifying insights to be shared for downstream activity.Search. Identify. Discover.One could conclude that if a computer can read and understand medical records similar to the way a healthcare expert does then that technology should also enable semantic search. Want to know how many medical records contain “myocardial infarction without aspirin” or simply “male or female over 30 with pain”? SyTrue’s NLP OS™ empowers our users to search, identify and discover through semantic search, enterprise-wide.

Any change, e.g. a postponed delivery date for a purchase order, will immediately (real-time) cause a re-allocation of sales orders thus generating a new optimal allocation picture. All together this will ensure optimal fulfillment of as many sales orders as possible and the lowest possible inventory levels at any point in time.Visual overview of the allocation for complete sales ordersThe optimal ATP calculation is performed real-time for all open sales orders and the result is visualized using ”traffic light colors” directly in the sales order screen. In milliseconds you can, through the color recognition of the human eye, get an overview of the delivery capability for complete sales orders: Red is bad, while Yellow and Green is good.Traffic light allocation centerA red sales order line always means a disappointed customer who cannot get his goods on time, so any red order line must be dealt with to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. The well-featured Traffic light allocation center provides an overview of delivery options and provides tools to adjust delivery dates, reprioritize or manipulate so that no red order line / customer is left without attention.Time fence controlled reservationPhysical reservations are only used to signal that the picking process can be initiated as the actual allocation is performed when the sales order lines are entered and following upon any change among the expected receipts or on-hand levels. The physical reservations are established by a background process using a time fence controlled approach so that physical reservations first kick in very close to the picking process need to be started.Smart Reservation is developed in collaboration with Abena, Svendsen Sport, Trespass, Dr. Martens and Rosendahl Design Group.Per Munk Nielsen (Logistics Director at Rosendahl) says: "I have as responsible for the logistics department for years spent a lot of time re-arranging reservations to ensure that my customers receive their goods on time, these days are over after we got Smart Reservation. The solution has released a lot of resources in logistics and customer service departments”.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365-for-finance-and-operations/fsbdev.db0ad611-0325-4255-b812-d71b8d3e6372?tab=Overview~fsbdev.db0ad611-0325-4255-b812-d71b8d3e6372

Indirect methods add a substance to the cell cultures that highlights some of them. When the cells turn purple, the intensity of the reaction on the substance is visualized by a light or dark purple. However, this technique has a disadvantage. When there are two cells with completely different situations, they could both react to the substance with the same intensity. Therefore, it is not a very reliable method. In addition, the sample will be useless because of the added substance. To replace the indirect technique, CytoSMART has developed the CytoSMART Omni. This product conducts a live‐cell analysis of cell cultures inside any incubator. It is a small and affordable product that offers a stable environment for cell cultures. This revolutionary device needs less equipment and offers high quality for a relatively low price. Furthermore, the CytoSMART Omni is a live‐cell analysis, so it does not use substances that lead to unreliable results and influenced samples.Life science is about studying living organisms. Yet most life science microscopes cannot look at effects over time. The development of microscopes has been held back by the need to process unprecedented amounts of data automated microscopes produce.Therefore, CytoSMART uses Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence in the Azure Cloud.The market can be divided into four segments.

They are so named because the final chart visually resembles either one half of or a complete tornado.A tornado chart is a common tool used to depict the sensitivity of a result to changes in selected variables. It shows the effect on the output of varying each input variable at a time, keeping all the other input variables at their initial (nominal) values.

Typically next step would be to perform a forecast for the next time period. The decomposition of time series is a statistical method that splits a time series into several components, each representing one of the underlying processes. There are three components that are typically of interest: trend, seasonality and noise.  Time series decomposition is an essential analytics tool to understand time series components and to improve a forecast. You can control the algorithm parameters and the visual attributes to suit your needs. The current visual implements the well-known “Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess” approach.Highlighted features:<ul><li> The underlying algorithm requires the input data to be equally spaced time series </li></ul><ul><li> Seasonal factor can be found automatically or set by user </li></ul><ul><li> The choice of additive or multiplicative model can be performed automatically or set by user</li></ul><ul><li> Time series decomposition is a powerful analytics tool.

Unique to this chart, the “tails” on each bubble give an indication of change in data from the previous data point (see Play Axis below).  The chart supports Name, numerical X-Axis and Y-Axis, and optional Bubble Size, Left Bar, Right Bar and a Play Axis.  Bubbles are categorized by Name and can be grouped by the Play Axis (typically a time-based measurement).  When a Play Axis is provided, a slider is displayed below the chart that allows the user to move to the Next or Previous Play Axis item and a play button allows the user to continuously loop through the Play Axis items until paused. One intended example would be a comparison of two retail companies and their performance in all the US States.  Each state (Name) would have data describing performance (X-Axis) in that state, how important that state is (Y-Axis) considered by the two companies (e.g. the total number of locations that both companies have in that state), how large the potential market (Bubble Size) is (e.g. the state's population), and how many locations each company has in that state (Left Bar and Right Bar).

The software visualizes the workflow and makes it easy to manage projects. The SharePoint editions of Kanban Task Manager are especially suitable for users who need to reach the tasks from anywhere and for managers who supervise several workgroups. Kanban Task Manager SharePoint Add-in can be downloaded from SharePoint Store to the site where it should be used. The traditional kanban board uses cards that tell what and how much should be produced and when it should be done. When managers get such a visual picture of the work process, they can quickly reveal bottlenecks and blockers. Less time is spent on trying to sort out how projects are coming along, because everything is visible on the kanban board.Working in kanban style with tasks in SharePoint gives you everything in the computer, and on top of that the developers of kalmstrom.com Business Solutions have added several useful features:<ul><li>Drag and drop tasks within or between phases and lanes</li></ul><ul><li>Filter tasks by project, responsible and/or priority and if enabled also by a custom value</li></ul><ul><li>Search of task subjects and body texts</li></ul><ul><li>Automatic synchronization of tasks within the workgroup, so everything is always up to date and everyone can see what is happening</li></ul><ul><li>Create a checklist for each task</li></ul><ul><li>For tasks having same steps to be performed, create checklist template for the checklist steps</li></ul><ul><li>Time logging to keep track of invested time per task</li></ul><ul><li>Display of tasks for multiple projects in one Kanban board</li></ul><ul><li>Possibility to create swim lanes</li></ul><ul><li>WIP limits gives a warning when there are too many tasks</li></ul><ul><li>Excel reports that show statistics on the task management</li></ul><ul><li>Add multiple responsibles for a single task.</li></ul><ul><li>Month and Project views</li></ul><ul><li>Daily trend and Day report views</li></ul><ul><li>Overdue indicators</li></ul><ul><li>Flexible number of columns in each phase</li></ul><ul><li>Set default values for tasks list fields</li></ul><ul><li>Kanban Task Manager App Part</li></ul><ul><li>My Open Tasks</li></ul>This version will work for 30 days.

The software as a service platform includes an easy-to-use app, a web-based Control Center, 24/7 live response center monitoring, and optional wearables and devices – to protect anyone in your company, wherever they are.- Two-way communication with emergency response staff - Configurable escalation procedures - Ability for response center to standardize on software to increase response times - “Neighbor-helping-neighbour” feature identifies others in the area who might help, whether or not they work at the same companyPrimarily used to protect those working alone and in high-risk environments, SafetyAware is leveraged by organizations in the energy, utilities, home care, government, field services, transportation and health care industries.Unlike traditional call-in programs where employees call their supervisor to let them know they are safe, SafetyAware uses app-based technology with location awareness to save employee time and take the burden off supervisors. Real Time Response Centers across Canada respond to SafetyAware alerts – such as missed check-ins and SOS alarms – providing a timely and pre-determined response outlined by the client.Working in remote locations with little or no cell coverage? No problem. Clients have the choice to use satellite devices with the same features as the SafetyAware App to keep remote workers in communication with the Real Time Response Center.~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/aware360-4880571.aware360_safetyaware?tab=Overview~aware360-4880571.aware360_safetyaware

[]~['Excel']~['Analytics', 'Productivity']~AneScan LLC~1.0.0.0~4/5/2016~AneScan Drug Usage Report~1~5.0 ~Drug Usage Report helps streamline audit, fraud, and waste detection.~Pharmacists need to document the amount of drugs dispensed to patients for during surgical procedures. This information is currently provided by hand written anesthesia records which are often hard to read, susceptible to human error, and allows for no data analytics across patients and medical facilities to detect usage trends or fraud. Many hospitals across the US lose hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on improper drug record keeping and have significant legal liability exposure. Solution: AneScan provides an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system for the anesthesia provider to track information such as patient, medical procedures, staff involvement, and drug usage information. Using AneScan helps the providers track required information for billing and clinical documentation purposes. Since this data is already being tracked and recorded, this information (or a subset) can be distributed to clients (or third parties through the use of Azure Cloud Services API). AneScan provides a Drug Usage Excel Add-in that gives the user access to information to help streamline the audit, fraud detection and waste detection process. Ultimately the Excel Add-In leads to improved patient care and safety. Benefits of Excel Add-In: • Digitally captures amount of drugs administered for pharmacists, improving documentation and facilitating audits. • Allows facilities to enforce national standards and protocols for delivery of drugs. Anesthesia providers that are not following protocols can be identified quickly and training can be provided to immediately correct any improper clinical techniques. • Provides opportunities to anesthesia groups to closely monitor drug administration for certain procedures, comorbidities, patient weight, narcotic drug abusers, etc.. • Facilitates clinical studies of drug administration. • Enables detection of narcotic waste, which will lead to reduction of narcotic waste and related cost saving for the hospital/surgery center.NOTE: This Excel Add-in requires Excel 2016 or higher in order to run.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can read and make changes to your document</li><li>Can send data over the Internet</li>~['Work or school account', 'Microsoft account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380130?tab=Overview~WA104380130

[]~['PowerPoint']~['Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Reference']~DOT group~1.0.0.0~2/27/2017~Slide Index Monitor~0~NA~Built so developers can monitor the index of the slides being viewed in a PowerPoint presentation.~The "Slide Index Monitor" add-in has been developed to enable software developers to capture the index of the slide being viewed in a PowerPoint presentation. It does so using JavaScript, so it is specially handy for web applications.In practice, inserting this add-in in one of your presentations will trigger a message whenever the add-in detects that the index of the slide being viewed has changed.More details in our little Q&amp;A below.---------------------------------------------------------    Q&amp;AQ: Why was this add-in created?A: It was created so our company could use embed power point presentations in our web app and monitor what slides of those presentations are viewed by our users.Q: What does this add-in offer?A: This add-in provides a way to programmatically monitor the index of the slides viewed in a power point presentation.Q: How does it work?A: It works by polling the power point presentation every quarter of a second. If the index of the slide being viewed at the polling time is different from the one at the last check, this "new" index is "broadcast".Q: Can you give us an example as to why this is relevant?A: Of course. Imagine you are developing a learning management system, that this system offers classes, and that the content of these classes are a bunch of power point presentations.Those presentations are shown in your LMS (learning management system) using Microsoft's live office and are therefore "embed" in your system. It works pretty well, but you are left with a problem, how can you monitor your students' progress? The PowerPoint presentations are a really nice way to deliver content, but there's not way for you to know how much of that content has actually been viewed by the students. This is one scenario where this add-in would be pretty useful. Using this add-in, your system will gain access to the index of the slides viewed by your users, enabling you to track their progress. Q: So, this add-in is actually meant for developers?A: Yes, pretty much. Even though "regular users" could add it to their presentation, the only effect they would see is an "ugly box" in their power point presentation, that displays the number (index) of the slide it was placed in.Q: An ugly box?A: Don't worry, it can be resized or dragged out of view (displaying the add-in is not the goal here).Q: How do I configure this add-in?A: You don't. To use it, simply add it to a power point presentation.Q: But how can I use it?A: After it's been added to a power point presentation, the add-in will broadcast every quarter of a second the number of the slide being viewed. That number is broadcast using JavaScript's Window.postMessage() method and can be captured by an event listener e.g. window.addEventListener("message", receiverMethod, false). Both "message" and "event listener" are basic JavaScript concepts and are really well explained in the the article found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage .Q: Do I have to add it to every slide of my presentation?A: No, only to the first one.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can read and make changes to your document</li><li>Can send data over the Internet</li>~['Work or school account', 'Microsoft account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380781?tab=Overview~WA104380781

This feature will help you to filter specific cluster within your data and update your report accordingly.Other important features are:- Legend that supports selection- Ability to change colors of the bars - you can set specific color for each Legend categoryHow to use Small Multiple feature:Visuals have following additional “small multiple” field buckets:- Column By- Row By (can be filled only together with Column By)User can define rows and columns of the visual in two ways: - Set both “Row By” and “Column By” field buckets. In this case rows and columns will be generated based on those category values- Set only “Column By” field bucket and leave “Row By” empty. In that case there will be only one dimension of small multiple categories, and small multiples will be generated from left to right and wrap to the next row – similar as left-to-right text direction in a page.Note: Color saturation can be set only if Legend is not set.Hope you enjoy our custom visual for Power BI!

[]~['Power BI visuals']~['Analytics', 'Advanced Analytics']~Microsoft Corporation~1.0.2.0~5/7/2018~Outliers Detection~6~4.3 ~Find outliers in your data, using the most appropriate method and plot~An outlier is an observation, such as a data point, that exists a significant distance from most other observations. Outliers sometimes occur due to measurement errors. Other times, outliers can be indicators of important occurrences or events.One such example is fraud detection, where outliers may indicate fraudulent activity. As such, outlier detection and analysis is an interesting and challenging data mining task.  There are many different methods to detect outliers.  In this Custom Visual, we implement five very popular detection methods: 1. Zscore is a standard deviation approach. For more details see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score2. Tukey’s method, which uses interquartile (IQR) range approach. For more details see: http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/3. LOF (Local Outlier Factor) method, which computes the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. It considers samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors as outliers. For more details see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_outlier_factor4. Cook's distance, which shows the influence of each observation on the fitted response values. An observation with Cook's distance larger than three times the mean Cook's distance might be an outlier. For more details see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%27s_distance5. Finally, the manual method allows you to define your own upper and lower thresholds for the original data.In addition to those methods, we support three ways to visualize outliers: * Scatter plot * Box plot* Density plotFor each plot type, you can decide to visualize the original data, or outlier scores. NEW: support for tooltips on hover and selection.Here is how it works: <ul><li> Define required fields to be analyzed in the plot. At least one numeric column of "Variables" for all detection methods and at least one numeric column for "Independent Variables" for Cook's detection method. </li></ul><ul><li> Avoid using multivariate inputs where possible, otherwise the results will not always be interpretable [#LI][#LI] Optionally, define a unique ID field (highly recommended to avoid duplicates removal)  </li></ul><ul><li> Optionally, provide the fields to be shown in tooltips upon hover </li></ul><ul><li> Select one of the detection methods, or use the default </li></ul><ul><li> Use detection parameters such as thresholds to refine the characteristics of outliers </li></ul><ul><li> Use numerous formatting controls to refine the visual appearance of the plot </li></ul>R package dependencies (which are auto-installed): scales, reshape, ggplot2, plotly,  htmlwidgets, XML, DMwRSupports R versions: R 3.4.1, R 3.3.3, R 3.3.2, MRO 3.2.2 This is an open source visual.

Thanks to Augmented Store, the company can show the full range of its productswithout the need for large exhibition areas.With Microsoft Hololens, the consumer can see the holograms of the products as miniatures (orin full scale if the experience focuses on a single item and not on an elaborate room), laying ona horizontal surface, and walks around them to appreciate every detail.With a MR immersive headset, customers can immerse themselves in the company's virtualshowroom, a digital exhibition space in 1:1 scale, where they can view all the products as if theywere real and interact with them by changing colours and finishes. Customers live the retail experience using Microsoft HoloLens and Mixed Reality Headset: these devicesallow them to visualize the top products of the shopping experience in immersive and holographicmode, both in full and customised scale.The experience can be enriched by other Microsoft products like Microsoft Surface Studio 2: theseproducts are available to sellers and store managers through a UWP APP that exploits the potential ofthe touchscreen and the quality of the Surface display to guide customers into their shoppingexperience. The seller can interact with the virtual space in which potential customers are immersed toguide them through the visit and show them the different finishes or models of the items for sale. Thisstep avoids the direct interaction of those customers who may not know the MR device and could so be"victims of technological embarrassment". They can, therefore, focus exclusively on the experience andnot on the product.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/hevolus-5207946.augmentedstore?tab=Overview~hevolus-5207946.augmentedstore

The fees supported in these activities are only non-deductible in a certain proportion.In order to make it easier for companies to calculate in a simple way, we have developed the VAT prorrata application for 365 Business Central designed so that it can be applied both for the pro-rata rule, as well as for non-deductible fees in full, with the great advantage that it is calculated and recorded automatically, saving time and possible errors if it is done manually.The system, by itself, calculates and adjusts the percentage of definitive pro-rata, being able to account for pro-rata on the same expense of the invoice or on a specific expense account. The cost of the pro-rata is passed on to the cost of the product or of the fixed asset and if you have the SII of ACTIO, the correct quota and deductible quota data are sent.<ul><li>Configuration of VAT rates without deductibles, accounting and VAT registration groups: The system allows to differentiate the types of pro rata that exist in the company depending on the activity of the company and can define the operation of the pro rata.</li><li>It is reflected in your invoices and purchase credits automatically: It has a new page that allows you to define the VAT declaration excluding the pro rata movements from the total VAT calculation.</li><li>Prepare VAT returns and regularize the non-deductible VAT: The pro rata is counted on invoices and purchase credits automatically, so the user must not take any additional steps.</li><li>Calculation of the final pro rata: The application allows you to calculate the percentage of non-deductible VAT applicable in an exercise.</li></ul>This application is available only in Spanish.

This process is fully automated. Integra provides information on stock availability, helps to choose the optimal supplier or reserve products, confirms the completion of each order item and speeds up delivery – all in real time. Integra combines most distributor systems from various branches in one network. It is a perfect via-point for your orders that transfers them directly to selected suppliers. Detailed order status enables you to monitor your order item by item as soon as the order is placed. This is how you know why your order has not been partially or fully completed. Order confirmations are sent to distributors automatically. As Integra provides the stock quantities of every distributor’s subsidiaries, you can select a suitable distributor for each order item. This speeds up delivery. You can preview stock quantities in the form of reports. Daily updates on out of stock items and the stock quantities of each distribution branch help you to effectively perform stock management for individual distributors. By comparing stock quantities against upcoming demand (i.e. representatives’ orders) and turnover, you will be able to forecast the required stock quantity per each day. As a result, orders will be completed quickly and seamlessly.<b>What is the business need/challenge?</b>Order delivery is one of the most significant factors in the sales process. Bearing this in mind, we created the Integra system in 2006. It helps companies to increase their sales by integrating manufacturers with distributors.The Integra system significantly reduces order processing time. Error elimination results in a higher number of orders and lower operational costs.<b>What are the benefits/outcomes?</b><ul>• Improved level of order completion • Fewer errors related to order processing&lt; • Decreased order adjustments and complaints • More efficient settlement process • Increased productivity  • Shorter order completion time • Enhanced customer service • Lower logistics and production costs thanks to effective delivery planning  • Quick increase in sales thanks to access to stock availability data and elimination of OOS  • Information on product availability provided when placing an order allows for faster purchase decisions • Reliable and automated settlements with representatives • Faster delivery • Optimization of the process of putting orders together at the warehouse • Lower order processing costs </ul>~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/sagra-technology.emigointegra?tab=Overview~sagra-technology.emigointegra

Or it can also be simply used to make the dashboard more lively and animated. Please refer to the sample report for examples on how to use it in different configurations, especially note that the initial scale is set to 100 units in the visual and data added should be converted to percentages for efficient performance, but if you have creative ideas on showing multiple rows of icons the visual does support it, go to the advanced edit mode to tweak these settings.

[]~['Web Apps']~['Artificial intelligence', 'Internet of things']~BatteryCheck s.r.o.~v1~NA~BatteryCheck~0~NA~Solving tomorrow’s battery problems today.~Rapid transition to renewable resources seemingly could be a good cure, however, renewables when evaluated on a standalone basis show lower efficiency. The game changes significantly when renewable resources of energy get combined with energy storage solutions - essentially rechargeable batteries. With battery prices dropping to one third in the last two years and further cost reduction expected as we move forward, battery storage will play much more significant role in energy markets of the future. The key challenge in this context is to understand how battery storage performance may be optimized, explore new ways of used battery application and maximize useful lifetime of the storage equipment. Achievement of these objectives would not be possible without a data-analytics based solution that would be capable of producing and analyzing relevant data about the state of each individual battery equipment. Equally as important is to formulate a set off recommendation to users to support well-informed decisions about re-purposing and disposal.To address these challenges, we offer our intelligent cloud-based proprietary analytical software solution which is monitoring the battery and collecting key performance parameter measurements straight from the Battery Management System (BMS). These data will be subject to further processing and AI calculations and subsequently form the basis for the BatteryCheck core services:<b>1. EVotchi</b>, a service watching over battery performance, identifies anomalies within time series of data from BMS and then provides personalized recommendations to users how to behave. <b>2. ABEL </b>(<b>A</b>verage <b>B</b>attery <b>E</b>nd of <b>L</b>ife) creates prediction based on AI/ML calculations about the forthcoming end of life of specific battery system. The service will also guarantee that the data will not be manipulated (blockchain), thus unlocking new market opportunities (including new financing options) for used electric vehicles and energy storage systems in other industrial applications as parties will know the objective condition of the battery.<b>3. BaLiMa</b> (<b>Ba</b>ttery <b>Li</b>fecycle <b>Ma</b>nagement), in turn, will recommend the best moment for re-purposing the equipment, i.e. when the battery ceased being a good fit for its primary use scenario but fully capable of taking on secondary life and serving to another purpose. This service will provide recommendation for optimal timing of final disposal of the battery - recycling. BatteryCheck not only delivers on UN's Climate Action goal (SDG#13) and Affordable and Clean Energy goal (SDG#7) but it also helps foster circular economy by prolonging effective utilization of all raw materials used in manufacturing of batteries until the time when chemical and physical properties won't allow holding any electric charge.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/batterychecksro.batterycheck?tab=Overview~batterychecksro.batterycheck

This process is fully automated. Integra provides information on stock availability, helps to choose the optimal supplier or reserve products, confirms the completion of each order item and speeds up delivery – all in real time. Integra combines most distributor systems from various branches in one network. It is a perfect via-point for your orders that transfers them directly to selected suppliers. Detailed order status enables you to monitor your order item by item as soon as the order is placed. This is how you know why your order has not been partially or fully completed. Order confirmations are sent to distributors automatically. As Integra provides the stock quantities of every distributor’s subsidiaries, you can select a suitable distributor for each order item. This speeds up delivery. You can preview stock quantities in the form of reports. Daily updates on out of stock items and the stock quantities of each distribution branch help you to effectively perform stock management for individual distributors. By comparing stock quantities against upcoming demand (i.e. representatives’ orders) and turnover, you will be able to forecast the required stock quantity per each day. As a result, orders will be completed quickly and seamlessly.<b>What is the business need/challenge?</b>Order delivery is one of the most significant factors in the sales process. Bearing this in mind, we created the Integra system in 2006. It helps companies to increase their sales by integrating manufacturers with distributors.The Integra system significantly reduces order processing time. Error elimination results in a higher number of orders and lower operational costs.<b>What are the benefits/outcomes?</b><ul>• Improved level of order completion • Fewer errors related to order processing&lt; • Decreased order adjustments and complaints • More efficient settlement process • Increased productivity  • Shorter order completion time • Enhanced customer service • Lower logistics and production costs thanks to effective delivery planning  • Quick increase in sales thanks to access to stock availability data and elimination of OOS  • Information on product availability provided when placing an order allows for faster purchase decisions • Reliable and automated settlements with representatives • Faster delivery • Optimization of the process of putting orders together at the warehouse • Lower order processing costs </ul>~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/sagra-technology.emigointegra?tab=Overview~sagra-technology.emigointegra

CONSPRO is developed within the Project Module of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.CONSPRO  can be used by contractors who construct infrastructure projects, roads, dams, highways, airports and industrial buildings and by the builders who build residential and commercial properties as well as engineering companies for their projects.It is not a country specific solution. It can be used in any country. Any Chart of Accounts can be used to parametrically to map Balance Sheet Accounts and Income Statement Accounts. Percentage of Completion Method adjustments can be made to arrive at IFRS Financial Statements.Construction project budgets can be built and revisions can be made in numerous versions, each version is saved and can be revisited. The budgeting process starts with the determination of the activities and their cost. BOQ (Bill of Quantities) in monetary and physical units are detailed for these activities. Labor cost can be obtained from any payroll software via integration to fill in the predetermined labor cost tables to allocate the labor cost to the appropriate construction activities. Alternatively, labor cost can be filled in manually into the predetermined labor cost tables.Then the construction contract with the employer is used to build the budgeted revenues.Budgeted and Actual costs can be compared. Completed work and remaining work in terms of monetary and physical units can be followed up instantly. The progress payments can be prepared automatically and can be revised instantly.CONSPRO can be fully integrated with PRIMAVERA subject to some customization at both ends.

Its industrial data pipeline is built to give context to abstract data in the language of the industrial asset while its data engine automates machine learning and presents it in a language SMEs understand--promoting in-house ML solutions. With a highly interpretable ML, the Quartic Platform increases adoption, trust, and sustainability of industrial AI and allows you to easily integrate ML with real-time data to define business and control logic, making AI actionable. The intelligence created using the Quartic Platform® can be connected back to your existing OT systems like DCS and OSI PI historian so your operations and maintenance staff can continue to use existing workflows and tools. <b>The Platform</b>Comprising of two main components, each with a set of application modules, the Platform can be deployed in a hybrid Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture on Azure.<li>illuminator™, an OT data lake provides IIoT, OT, MES, and ERP data in dynamic context to intelligence applications in eXponence™. Expert users can use its fully integrated contextual data pipe to build AI applications with tools and libraries of their choice.</li><li>eXponence™ uses automated ML, a rules engine, and Complex Event Processing (CEP) to build the intelligence and provides visualization and communication of the intelligence. Visualization and communication functions can be performed alternatively with your legacy or new OT systems simply by connecting the intelligence output from eXponence™. </li>While built using the most modern and powerful AI techniques and technology, the differentiation of the Platform is its industrially focused design. Crafted for OT professionals and industrial subject matter experts, it empowers them to build IIoT systems compliant with IIRA (ISO/IEC/IEEE42010:2011) and RAMI 4.0 with very little training or culture change. With just a few clicks, it connects to data stranded in legacy equipment and puts it in the context of operations.

The measurements from these devices are then sent to a mobile device via Bluetooth - where they feed into our back-end data analytics solution.<b>ARMED’s mission is simple:</b><i>“To provide technology enabled care solutions which empower people to remain independent in their home for longer.”</i>ARMED was developed in recognition of the growing importance of prevention and self-management. Capturing data from an individual and their home environment and combining with powerful machine learning allows changes to be identified so that action can be taken.Data from the wearables can be combined with various other data feeds, with some of our other pilot sites choosing to combine information from the wearable technologies with social care data such as quantitative electronic call monitoring information, qualitative wellbeing information, qualitative assessment information and Service User feedback. Once in our back-end analytics solution, ARMED triangulates all of the data captured to create a 'risk profile' for each Service User, correlating their health metrics over any given period of time, so the Council will be able to identify a health decline in a Service User - before a health event happens and interventative care is required. ARMED focuses on highlighting risk in individuals with complex needs, so that care can be focused in the areas where it truly needs to be, with less staff / resource required.  ARMED brings benefits to individuals and their families, Care Providers and the wider community. By encouraging self-management and identifying at-risk individuals sooner, there is potential to save millions of pounds from the public purse.Additionally, it is acknowledged as to the importance of Housing is now recognised as an important part of someone’s wellbeing - alongside their care and support.  Monitoring various aspects of the home environment has benefits for the individual and the housing provider. Earlier intervention to issues within a property will provide for an improved tenant experience as well as reduce the reactive costs, allow strategic decisions regarding budget &amp; resourcing priorities and positively increase the longevity of the building fabric.  Data captured from environmental based sensors, collected via low power, long range networks such as LoRa facilitates a cost-effective manner for collecting data.  Such data is then captured within ARMED solution with escalating risks identified arising from this.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/hastechnologyltd.armed?tab=Overview~hastechnologyltd.armed

However, simply having the data in the same place does not automatically mean you can use it to make useful comparisons.When analysing Attendance, Student Demographics and Exclusions consistency is to a large extent guaranteed by the high degree of statutory control over what and how data is recorded. For this reason much of our early BI development has been in these areas.Assessment data in Bromcom is tied to meaningful associations such as the subject, year and term of the collection as well as the assessment type. This means that in order for trust wide assessment analysis to be possible, MATs must harmonise their subject and year names. While this requires an investment of effort, it will be more than repaid due to the better analysis and easier sharing of expertise enabled by use of common names and structures. The new Group Details page in the MIS means that making these changes is quicker and easier than before.A consistent naming convention is a necessary condition for effective analysis in MAT Vision but not a sufficient one. Two teachers can use the same form to describe a Prediction, in Maths, in Year 11 in Autumn of grade 5 – but the underlying realities they are describing with those two judgments could still be wildly different.Technology can only play a limited role in solving this dilemma. However, it’s important to raise here because for many trusts the process of getting data, any data, in a collated form has been so torturous that it can feel like the end of a journey. We would be doing our customers if we presented MAT Vision as a short cut to that destination. Easily collating teacher judgments from across the trust is not the end of a process but the beginning, as those judgments must be checked and calibrated before they can be relied upon to provide meaningful information.~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi/bromcomcomputersplc-1119791.bromcom-mat-vision-secondary-schools-analytics?tab=Overview~bromcomcomputersplc-1119791.bromcom-mat-vision-secondary-schools-analytics

['Education']~['Power BI apps']~['Analytics', 'Finance', 'IT + administration']~BROMCOM COMPUTERS PLC~NA~NA~MAT Vision Analytics for Secondary Schools (SQL)~0~NA~Bromcom MAT Vision Analytics for Secondary Schools (SQL)~Bromcom’s MAT Vision has removed a great barrier to efficiency many of our MAT customers faced as it means data flows automatically from Bromcom Cloud MIS systems into a central warehouse and so they no longer need to manually chase schools for data and manually add it to spreadsheets. However, simply having the data in the same place does not automatically mean you can use it to make useful comparisons.When analysing Attendance, Student Demographics and Exclusions consistency is to a large extent guaranteed by the high degree of statutory control over what and how data is recorded. For this reason much of our early BI development has been in these areas.Assessment data in Bromcom is tied to meaningful associations such as the subject, year and term of the collection as well as the assessment type. This means that in order for trust wide assessment analysis to be possible, MATs must harmonise their subject and year names. While this requires an investment of effort, it will be more than repaid due to the better analysis and easier sharing of expertise enabled by use of common names and structures. The new Group Details page in the MIS means that making these changes is quicker and easier than before.A consistent naming convention is a necessary condition for effective analysis in MAT Vision but not a sufficient one. Two teachers can use the same form to describe a Prediction, in Maths, in Year 11 in Autumn of grade 5 – but the underlying realities they are describing with those two judgments could still be wildly different.Technology can only play a limited role in solving this dilemma. However, it’s important to raise here because for many trusts the process of getting data, any data, in a collated form has been so torturous that it can feel like the end of a journey. We would be doing our customers if we presented MAT Vision as a short cut to that destination. Easily collating teacher judgments from across the trust is not the end of a process but the beginning, as those judgments must be checked and calibrated before they can be relied upon to provide meaningful information.~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi/bromcomcomputersplc-1119791.bromcom-mat-vision-secondary-schools-analytics-sql?tab=Overview~bromcomcomputersplc-1119791.bromcom-mat-vision-secondary-schools-analytics-sql

Such measurements are required for regulatory, health and safety reasons, and correct monitoring can mean the difference between life and death as well as commercial success. Our full stack, plug and play solution consists of sensors that record temperatures in real time, cloud data storage and integrated web and mobile apps for reporting and analytics. Sensee can be instantly deployed at a fraction of the cost of competitor solutions with RoI immediately visible to business owners and managers.<strong>Industry Challenge:</strong>Products such as fresh and frozen food, drugs, vaccines and blood samples are extremely sensitive to temperature with products easily spoiling or experiencing quality degradation.  Strict national and international regulations exist to ensure the correct processes are carried out at all stages in the manufacturing, distribution, preparation and handling of such perishable goods. Improper temperature monitoring is responsible for up to 3,000 deaths and 120,000 hospitalizations each year in the US alone as well as the loss of up to 20% of all food produced each year globally in an $8 trillion industry. Similarly, it is estimated that up to 30% of all drugs and vaccines in the pharmaceutical industry are lost due to temperature excursions at some stage in their manufacturing and distribution. Unfortunately, temperature monitoring processes are still predominantly carried out using pen and paper making them inefficient, time consuming and mistake prone.<strong>Solution Benefits:</strong><ul><li>Save money by preventing valuable inventory from being lost or damaged due to equipment failure or human error</li><li>Protect customer health and the spread of illness associated with temperature excursions</li><li>Automate regulatory reporting and HACCP compliance with reports for use in health department inspections and record keeping</li><li>Save many hours of employee time</li><li>Improve quality control, operational efficiency and brand reputation</li></ul><strong>Solution Features:</strong><ul><li>Proprietary system with industry-leading technology that works in the harshest environments</li><li>Plug and play, installed in minutes, no technological expertise required</li><li>Inexpensive monthly or annual pricing turns high upfront capex into affordable opex</li><li>Customizable alerts sent 24/7 to a designated person or group when temperatures fall outside of bounds, allowing clients to act quickly when problems occur</li><li>Easy-to-use front-end system (web and mobile) for analytics &amp; reporting that yields insights into broader operational improvements such as resource optimization, inventory management and predictive maintenance of equipment</li></ul>~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/sensee.iot-temperature-monitoring?tab=Overview~sensee.iot-temperature-monitoring

Yet asset-intensive industries face a fundamental challenge converting their asset data into analytics. Asset data is stored in silos across many production sites and systems, out of reach for most data consumers. Simply consolidating asset data in a data lake doesn’t solve the problem because without context you can’t find all the operational signals in the data. Modeling asset data to build that context is challenging because of the complex structure and semantics of asset data, especially sensor data. Element AssetHub™ eliminates the data challenges holding back analytics with an all-in-one solution that integrates, harmonizes, and contextualizes your asset data. AssetHub is a multi-faceted solution to connect disparate asset data sources, manage data modeling through Asset Twins (the dynamic digital representations of physical assets), and share common data models and asset data for easy consumption across  the enterprise. AssetHub is delivered on a modern cloud-native architecture to overcome the integration, data modeling, and persistence challenges inherent in utilizing asset data for advanced industrial analytics.  AssetHub unlocks your asset data, providing a 360° view of every asset, enabling advanced analytical and AI applications.AssetHub’s architecture supports hybrid data connectivity to data sources of any type, whether on-premise or cloud-based.

Wherever you need it.Why should you implement perfektus onePerfektus one can be implemented in manufacturing plants or at retail stores. The information we gather is converted into valuable and actionable KPIs that benefit managers and directors so they can be better informed when they have to make decisions.In manufacturing plants we help production, maintenance and quality teams be always informed about their processes. Using specialized predictive intelligence, we help them analyze the information as it flows in real time. With this information we can predict the best time to give maintenance to a machine or predict the total energy consumption for a manufacturing line in the month. It can also be applied to predict how much scrap will be generated and the main reasons. With this information, actions can be taken in time to prevent problems and defects in the production.In retail stores we help owners and managers determine the effectiveness of a store by knowing the conversion rate between potential customers and actual sales. By understanding how many customers enter the store, understand how the move inside, and capturing their emotions when paying or looking at the products, we can maximize the sales potential by recommending different layout of products at different times of day. We also measure the actual impact of advertising campaigns by identifying the actual increase in customers entering the store, segmenting them by gender and age.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/iqbit.perfektusone_retail_contactme?tab=Overview~iqbit.perfektusone_retail_contactme

For example, whether it's a table or a car, or        red or blue.</li></ul> Attributes add detail, and are valuable in a number of contexts. For example, they can refine results when you search for an item. You can include attributes, such as a “red” bike or a “wooden” table, and avoid scrolling through a long list of all bikes or tables. Attributes are also useful when you define market segments in Relationship Management. Adding age and gender can deepen your understanding of each segment and, for example, target campaigns more effectively.  You can control the accuracy of the suggested attributes. Image Analyzer suggests attributes based tags that the Computer Vision API finds, and a confidence level that you can specify. The confidence level lets you specify how precise you need to be. After you enable the extension, Image Analyzer kicks in each time you add an image to an item or contact person. You'll see the attributes, confidence level, and details right away, and can decide what to do with each attribute.<strong>Supported editions:</strong>This app supports both the Essential and Premium editions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.<strong>Supported countries:</strong>United States, Canada, United Kingdom.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365-business-central/PUBID.microsoftdynsmb|AID.122a5810-db56-4536-a8d0-e5aa71b4fb78|PAPPID.e868ad92-21b8-4e08-af2b-8975a8b06e04?tab=Overview~PUBID.microsoftdynsmb|AID.122a5810-db56-4536-a8d0-e5aa71b4fb78|PAPPID.e868ad92-21b8-4e08-af2b-8975a8b06e04

['Distribution', 'Retail']~['Web Apps']~['Analytics', 'Marketing', 'Sales']~Neal Analytics~Version1~NA~Sales Driver Analysis~0~NA~Why do you sell? How do you sell more?~Whether sales are up or down, it is important for managers to understand why.  However, existing demand forecasting models do not sufficiently explain the portion of demand driven by each influencer on sales, limiting the usefulness of these forecasts to production planning use cases. Identifying the factors that cause sales to fluctuate is the first step in deciding what a retail or CPG company can do to grow their sales more efficiently. While some external and environmental factors such as the weather or holidays are outside management’s control, there are many factors such as sales coverage, advertising, pricing, and promotions that can and should be leveraged where they are most impactful by management teams to maximize sales. Machine learning algorithms can take all of the confounding factors in each market to identify key sales drivers and how much they individually impact sales at each store. With these insights, managers will be armed to tailor their strategies for each market and maximize sales across them.Understand drivers and forecast sales  Discover how sales are affected by location, segment, channel, packaging type, market category, or product type. Neal Analytics’ unique analytical methodology helps managers explain which levers influence sales, and by how much but at an unprecedented level of detail. Instead of analyzing sales drivers at a company-wide or otherwise aggregate level, we can determine how sales driver impact fluctuates across channels, product groups, or geographic territories. These insights are delivered continually instead of annually, enabling Neal Analytics’ Sales Driver Analysis to empower users with up-to-the-minute projections of sales impacts for a dynamic strategy. For example, if a company understands that a particular sports event is going to cause a significant increase in sales, it can adjust supply or pricing in order to match the new demand curve, and reset it when the event finishes. Reduce stock-outs and increase profitsWith deeper understanding in sales drivers and augmented demand forecasting, managers can tune and improve their strategies. For example, if temperature is going to increase next week and boost sales in a certain region, then preventing stock-outs rather than running a promotion event may be the key action item. Business strategies will be guided by managing the “levers” that impact sales outcome.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/neal-analytics.marketdriveranalysis?tab=Overview~neal-analytics.marketdriveranalysis

Another example could be that local governments would be able to launch special offers to exchange GreenYngs worth more if the citizen buys on local shops or a particular high street they want to promote. Of course, in smart operation it is implicit the possibility to do real time monitoring of the network of containers in order to improve collection routes.

To create a chart with automatic settings, simply select a data file and the variables to be plotted. The add-in provides you different views and helps you gain useful insights about the data and create high-quality plots. It is powered by a library of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) components which smoothly displays large datasets.The charts can display line plots, scatter plots, and area plots with linear or logarithmic scales. Zoom-dependent rendering provides fast access to single data points of the data set. The tables provide conventional functionality such as row selection, sorting, data searching, and filtering. In addition, ExploreTheData presents a zoomable graphical view of numerical data. Table column data operations (e.g., sum, mean, minimum, and maximum) are selectable from a menu, and the list of operations is extensible. ExploreTheData can handle large tables because all views are pre-calculated before rendering. The charts and tables are cross-linked, meaning that the data corresponding to the selected table rows are highlighted on the chart and vice versa. In addition, filtering the data in the table updates the chart accordingly.Data import and export is performed using text files (comma-separated values), JavaScript data files, or a range of cells selected in a worksheet open in Excel. ExploreTheData makes its own copy of the data without data binding between the source worksheet and the add-in. The chart can be exported as an SVG file.ExploreTheData is customizable by users in two ways: style files and JavaScript configuration files. The latter enables listing multiple data and style files which are then easily accessible from the drop-down menus.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can read and make changes to your document</li><li>Can send data over the Internet</li>~['Work or school account', 'Microsoft account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104379481?tab=Overview~WA104379481

It enables full transparency on all parameters for <b>drives, motors, mounted bearings and pumps</b>, and can also be applied to applications such as compressors, conveyors, mixers and extruder main shafts. Users can digitally “see” operational variables and health indicators through an integrated, one-stop portal – including availability, environmental conditions and fault events.Connected drives, motors, bearings and pumps provide data for advanced monitoring and analytics to improve- the performance - reliability - efficiencySafety for discrete industries: safety is critical to discrete industries such as the food and beverage and logistics sectors. A malfunction or mechanical problems in an application may cause a serious safety hazard for the machine and for employees. With ABB solution production managers and operators can identify malfunctions via the monitoring portal, remotely, to support safe operations.Reliability for process industries: process industries, such as mining, oil and gas, metals and pulp &amp; paper need to ensure 24/7 reliability of their operations. A process failure in any of these industries can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in unplanned downtime. Global mining company, Glencore, has been using the ABB Ability™ Digital Powertrain to have a broader view of equipment monitoring:“We use the condition monitoring service for powertrains in the seawater pumps system, that distributes cooling water in our factory. It is a critical part of the process, and we already have a monitoring solution for the pumps and motors connected to the control system but not remote monitoring for drives,” says Sigurd Bjerland, Maintenance Electrical Engineer at Glencore Nikkelverk. “The integration of ABB Ability™ gives us the possibility to collect more information on the cooling status of the drives and compare data coming from the two monitoring solutions. It is beneficial to be able to see the condition of our equipment online.”Efficiency for infrastructure: ABB Ability™ Digital Powertrain condition monitoring solutions are successfully used in cooling, heating, water and other building applications. The Swedish water utility company Uppsala Vatten och Avfall uses the solution so that its plant operators receive reports on real-time indicators like reliability, usage patterns, power consumption and stress levels. These are updated and accessible at any time. ABB specialists can analyze the equipment, for example to understand the impact of the environment on specific components. The key element in advanced analytics and maintenance planning for motors, pumps and mounted bearings is ABB Ability™ Smart Sensor, converting powertrain elements into smart, wirelessly connected IoT-devices.   ~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/abb-3963258.condition-monitoring-motors-drives-pumps?tab=Overview~abb-3963258.condition-monitoring-motors-drives-pumps

[]~['SharePoint']~['Analytics', 'IT + administration', 'Productivity']~Applications Consulting Training Solutions~1.0.0.1~6/26/2017~Build Better SharePoint Sites Fast~2~5.0 ~SkyGraph is a context modeler used to simplify SharePoint configuration and deployment.~SkyGraph uses drag and drop gestures for easy object selection. A canvas displays selected objects in a context diagram. SharePoint configuration requires navigation across many pages making the process laborious especially when the site requirements are extensive. SkyGraph cuts configuration time by 75%. SkyGraph is a one of a kind patented application whose functionality is unmatched and cannot be duplicated.Key SkyGraph Features:	*Easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI)	*Drag and drop functionality	*Design your SharePoint environment as you go	*Set permissions on the fly	*Fully customize your SharePoint sites	*Ready to use toolbox for lists, libraries, content types, and web parts	*Create multiple projects in a single SkyGraph environment	*Move nodes around without any coding	*Validate your design before publishing	*Reuse and deploy SkyGraph project(s) on other SharePoint servers within the farm	*Reduce complexity in SharePoint site deployment	*Rapid deployment of SharePoint sitesThe SkyGraph canvas allows for building a SharePoint site in a graphical manner, that is, a user can simply drag and drop SharePoint objects on to the canvas, configure properties and publish. Multiple projects can be created and saved that are easily editable anytime. SharePoint is a dynamic platform, and requires updates or changes within the enterprise that can have some challenging pressures including increase in costs. This is where SkyGraph comes to the rescue and its tight integration with SharePoint make it a robust solution, allowing for greater operational efficiency.This SharePoint add-in works in conjunction with another add-in, which is only available from the provider. This requires installation on your environment outside of the Microsoft Office Store processes due the level of required permissions. A tenant administrator will need to deploy this specific add-in to the tenant manually, so that it can be installed to your environment. When apps are installed outside of the Microsoft Office Store, they may bypass any, and all, safety and security checks provided by Microsoft.If you have not done so already, it is recommended that you establish contact with the provider before proceeding with installation.  Consider trying this add-in on a separate SharePoint Tenancy before installing it on your primary SharePoint site(s).Permissions Needed:1. ASP.NET MVC based UI application can work fine with the least permissions granted from the SkyGraph Add-in. Because it is only responsible for allowing the user to design the site hierarchy and store in database.2. Web Job requires higher permissions because it is responsible for creating the SharePoint site structure. It requires Full Control permission over tenant scope in order to create new site collections or update properties of existing site collection. These permissions cannot be acquired from the add-in that is installed from Office Store. That is why we follow the 2 package approach as recommended by Microsoft in the article below:https://dev.office.com/blogs/combining-store-add-ins-with-high-trust-permissionsIn our UI application, we encourage the user to download and install the high trust package in order for the publish work properly.  Our UI application uses the permissions granted from the Office Store Add-in and Web Job will run using permissions granted from privately deployed high trust Add-in.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104381138?tab=Overview~WA104381138

The decision tree learning automatically find the important decision criteria to consider and uses the most intuitive and explicit visual representation. Current visual implements the popular and widely used tools of recursive partitioning for decision tree construction. Each leaf of the tree is labeled with a class and a probability distribution over the classes. Beside this we use cross validation to estimate the statistical performance of the decision tree. If the target variable is categorical or has only few possible values the "Classification Tree" is constructed, whereas if the target variable is numeric the result of the visual is "Regression Tree".  You can control the algorithm parameters and the visual attributes to suit your needs. Here is how it works: <ul><li> Define the "Target Variable" (exactly one) and "Input Variables" (two or more columns) </li></ul><ul><li> Controll the basic properties of the tree such as maximum depth and the minimum observation number per leaf</li></ul><ul><li> If you are the advanced user, control the recursive partitioning and cross-validation parameters </li></ul>R package dependencies(auto-installed): rpart, rpart.plot, RColorBrewerSupports R versions: R 3.3.1, R 3.3.0, MRO 3.3.1, MRO 3.3.0, MRO 3.2.2 This is an open source visual.

UBIRCH's <b><i>Blockchain for Things</i></b> enables the creation of 100% trustworthy records for data-dependent business models – whenever and wherever accuracy, integrity or authenticity is essential.The UBIRCH protocol 'seals' data packets right on the edge device applying hard cryptography. Undetected manipulation, deletion or duplication of data packets is impossible after this sealing process – even, when the data is transmitted over unsecured com channels. Additionally each data packet can be attributed without doubt to a unique originating device. Finally, each data packet is anchored in a high-bandwidth, two-stage blockchain setup.The end result ist a 100% trustworthy, immutable set of records.The product comes in the form of 3 modules <ol><li>a firmware library running on the edge device </li><li>a cloud-based service (on Azure) for anchoring the data in a blockchain and integrity check of data packets from secured sensors</li><li>optionally a verification service running on premise in the client's data center or cloud</li></ol>Privacy and TrustEven though an important aspect of UBIRCH on Azure is an immutable blockchain, you can implement GDPR-compliant applications utilizing the ubirch protocol. Additionally, you don't have to trust us with your data. The UBIRCH protocol effectively consists of an envelope for the data transmission. This envelope “seals” and secures the payload it contains. The envelope is a conceptional one, though. In the actually data being exchanged between the sender and receiver, payload and envelope do not have to be transmitted together or in the same channel. In many applications it might be desirable (and is supported), to transmit the payload and the envelope/seal separately. This is accomplished by using a cryptographic hash function to create a digest of the original data packet and only transmitting the digest as the payload within the ubirch protocol envelope.Separating data and cryptographic seal enables customers to integrate the ubirch trust infrastructure without touching the original data pipeline.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/ubirch.ubirch_on_azure?tab=Overview~ubirch.ubirch_on_azure

Businesses are having too many documents and getting too many questions from employees and customers. And they are spending too much time for getting an answer from these documents. Alli will resolve this.How Alli is different:You don't need to spend any time for manual data tagging. Just upload your FAQ and documents, such as guidelines, legal documents, contracts and company knowledge documents, in Alli dashboard. All's AI will take care of the rest. Alli's AI will automatically find an answer directly from your FAQ or from your uploaded documents in a sentence level.How it can be possible:Alli is powered by Allganize's Machine Reading Comprehension technology. This is how machine reading comprehension is different from usual keyword search. Let's say you have 100,000 documents and you have one question: "how often should I do onsite exams?" If you put this question in the typical keyword search, you'll probably get around 5,000 documents which contains the word: how, should, or do. You need to check one by one manually. For reading 5,000 documents to check the answer, you will probably need more than an hour.However, if you put the very question in Alli, Allganize's machine reading comprehension API brings the answer in a sentence level such as "12 months is good and it can be extended into 18 months" within a second. So, more than an hour became just a second.What Alli can do:Alli will make you build the multi-turn conversation by using easy-to-use GUI: Chatflow Builder.

It can potentially cause public opposition to operations of odour generating facilities such as wastewater treatment plants and sewage sludge management practices. As a result, complaints which arise from episodes of exposure to odour are reported to regulatory authorities. The Odour Compliance Analytics app on DDP pulls odour data from real-time SCADA sources for monitoring the various threshold limits, wind speed, wind direction and odour spikes from the odour monitors (Hydrogen Sulphide gas and sludge gas) at Sewage Treatment Works (STW). The complaints from customers are tagged to the various odour spikes resulting in severe odour pollution incidents. Through the odour analytics dashboards depicting the odour data, investigation tasks linking the odour spike incidents and the complaints are tracked and monitored in real time to a full closure proactively before any major breach is reported to and by the regulatory authorities.Key Benefits<ul><li>Early detection of odour related spike and mitigation helps in taking informed decisions</li><li>Complaints arising from odour pollution incidents can be reduced which will help to prevent impact to stakeholders</li><li>Avoid penalties and reputational damage due to odour</li></ul>~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/wipro.wiproodourcompliance?tab=Overview~wipro.wiproodourcompliance

['Manufacturing']~['Web Apps']~['Artificial intelligence', 'Internet of things']~craftworks~1.0~NA~Anomaly detection for machine vision~0~NA~This system detects defects (anomalies) on images of industrial parts. ~Anomaly detection for machine visionProblemManufacturing companies, especially in the automotive supply industry, must meet high quality requirements. Above all, tolerance limits on produced components are very tight.Due to instabilities in industrial processes, scrap parts are repeatedly produced. For this reason, each component must be visually inspected. Of course, this is very time and resource intensiveSolutionThis product uses images from industrial cameras and detects defects on components. It processes images in real-time and classifies between good parts and bad parts. Furthermore, the system can also learn different types of defects to classify even more accurate between types.USPThree things that distinguishes this product from existing solutions:<ul><li><b>Easy scalable -</b> The system does not need to be configured with tolerance limits of parts. Instead it uses a couple labeled images (good parts / bad parts) and learns the tolerances itself. This way the solution can be adopted to new parts or different production lines very fast.</li><li><b>Few labeled images</b> - The solution uses a semi-supervised learning approach, meaning that in the core it uses an anomaly detection approach to identify abnormalities. On top it uses some human labeled images to validate the anomalies. </li><li><b>Visualizing defects</b> -  Classifying in real-time is the core functionality but the product is also able to visualize the defect on the image. So process engineers can faster inspect the images to stabilize their process.</li></ul>The solution supports Azure IoT Services and is currently only available in German.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/craftworks.anomaly-detection-for-machine-vision?tab=Overview~craftworks.anomaly-detection-for-machine-vision

['Distribution', 'Health']~['Web Apps']~['Artificial intelligence', 'Internet of things']~bosch~1.0~NA~RBEI Pharma Trace~0~NA~FMD compliant solution powered by IoT, blockchain and AI for providing end-to-end traceability~Bosch PharmaTrace is an interoperable IT solution powered by IoT, Blockchain and AI, built to equip its customers with strict compliance to the FMD. The solution is of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry due to the growing problem of counterfeiting- affecting both patient lives and revenue losses to the pharmaceutical companies along with the mandate to comply with the Falsified Medicines Directive. The solution focuses on the following key applications:•	Track and trace of prescription medicines:The use case uses the unique serialization number of each package to track it along the entire supply chain, across the stakeholders using the PharmaTrace solution.  Counterfeits are detected by alert flags raised by the system on scanning of the fake drug barcode. . A real time verification and validation of registered assets  with the regulator’s database thereby ensures robust leakage detection and control mechanism•	Saleable Returns / EMVS Verification: The verification of serialisation data at one or more stops along the supply chain is the next step in the EU FMD. After the manufacturers have generated the serialisation data, they must report the product master and production data to a centralised hub, known as the European Medicines Verification System (EMVS) and forwards all data to the respective National Systems. Channel partners have 10 days before they can add drugs back into the EMVS for reselling. PharmaTrace provides real time, secure verification of the product returned by the pharmacy to the distributor/wholesaler. PharmaTrace provides interoperability so that wholesalers and distributors can easily verify barcodes with the database and flags as well as logs transactions that are suspicious.•	Condition monitoring: The PharmaTrace blockchain platform is capable of interacting with the condition monitoring IoT device placed in the cold storage containers- large cold storages, refrigerators, vehicles, etc.  This use case is relevant for drugs that need to be stored under prescribed temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. E.g. Vaccines, photosensitive drugs. In case of any breaches, PharmaTrace’s autonomous agents raise flags, log into the system and reports it to the relevant stakeholders. The in-built track and trace mechanism then allows removal of spoiled medicines from the supply chain system.•	Certificate management: The use case ensures digitization of compliance certificates and supply chain documents like invoices, e-bill of lading, title of ownership, customs clearances, bank letters of credit etc., along with selective sharing of digital assets with relevant stakeholders like Pharma Company, distributors wholesalers and dispensers for compliance and completeness of the process. The benefits are seamless process optimization and faster payment cycles solves the problem of inefficiencies, forgery and large account receivables.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/bosch.rbei_pharma_trace?tab=Overview~bosch.rbei_pharma_trace

Useful to show connections between entities~The ability to visualize the relationship between items, the weightage of the relationship and the flow often brings out the untold insights into limelight, which are otherwise not very evident. Simple numbers and basic charts won’t be enough to discover and tell such data stories. We need new visualization techniques for the complex world of relationship and Force-Directed Graph thrives to the forefront for such scenarios.This custom visual implements a D3 force layout diagram with curved paths. The thickness of the path represents the weight of the relationship between the nodes.Since the relationship and interconnection between large set of entities could be very complex, the visual positions the nodes in such a way that there are few crossings as possible, making the exploration experience easy, fun. The visual also produces the layout which is overall pleasing to the eyes for large data sets. Users can also adjust the layout manually by simply dragging the nodes around.Ideally you would need two dimensions and one measure (for the weightage) to use with this visual.

These controls were designed specifically to help large and small political campaigns explore and draw insights from their data – but they’re useful for other audiences, too.To use the visuals, bring a dataset into Power BI, and put the custom visual on your page. There are two map types as part of this set: - The Drilldown Choropleth displays each location on a map filled with a color based on the value for each location.- The Drilldown Cartogram displays a circle for each location, with the size and color based on the values you specifyPut your data’s first-level location property in the Locations field, and the property you want to chart in the Values fields.Then on the visual’s Formatting pane, open the Shape customization and put the URL to the first level of your map in the Level 1 box, the URL to your next level in the Level 2 box, and so on. If the name of the geographic property of your map doesn’t match the name of the field in your data, you can set that property name in the ID boxes.You can alternately set a Legend property to control the color of each area on the map; this is useful to reflect things like which candidate or party had the most votes in an area.Note that you’ll need to put your topojson-formatted maps on a web server; the Tips page of the sample reports have guidance about how to do that.This visual was built in conjunction with our partner Gramener (http://gramener.com).This is an open source visual.

['Education']~['Teams']~['Productivity', 'Training + Tutorial']~Bigger Brains~1.1.0~8/1/2019~BrainBot - Boost your learning~0~NA~BrainBot sends short, periodic interactions to help you retain knowledge from training courses.~Did you ever take a class, and discover later that you can’t remember anything you learned?  It’s called the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve:  we naturally forget 70% of new information we learn within a day, and 90% within a week – if we don’t use it. Our brains are designed to discard new information if it isn’t used or reinforced regularly. BrainBot's unique AI chatbot solution fixes your “forgetting curve” with systematic and meaningful reinforcement boosts.  Starting a day or two after you complete an eLearning course or training class, BrainBot will send short, convenient boosts, delivered via Microsoft Teams or email. Each boost may consist of a question (multiple choice or text), a poll, a video, or another resource link designed to help you retain and even expand upon the information you learned.  Teachers can setup BrainBot to interact with learners on a specifically designed schedule, to maximize the effectiveness of each boost. It doesn’t take much - a typical boost sequence may include 6 to 9 interactions over a 30 to 90 day period. Best of all, BrainBot is uniquely designed to talk to each learner in the environments they already use every day: Microsoft Teams or Outlook. Many similar “booster” tools require users to use a proprietary app, and can only ask trivial multiple choice questions.  But because BrainBot’s unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, BrainBot can ask purposeful questions that use text, video, interactive polls, and more, to fully engage the learner’s brain and lead to greater knowledge retention. BrainBot was created by Bigger Brains, a premium online training company with dozens of courses that teach Microsoft Office, Office 365, leadership, communication, and other business productivity skills.  BrainBot boosts are available free with many Bigger Brains courses, and Teachers or other training providers can customize BrainBot for use in their own classes by signing up at https://brainbot.ai. Additional boosts are added regularly.In order to use the app user needs to have an Active BrainBot account.

However, simply having the data in the same place does not automatically mean you can use it to make useful comparisons.When analysing Attendance, Student Demographics and Exclusions consistency is to a large extent guaranteed by the high degree of statutory control over what and how data is recorded. For this reason much of our early BI development has been in these areas.Assessment data in Bromcom is tied to meaningful associations such as the subject, year and term of the collection as well as the assessment type. This means that in order for trust wide assessment analysis to be possible, MATs must harmonise their subject and year names. While this requires an investment of effort, it will be more than repaid due to the better analysis and easier sharing of expertise enabled by use of common names and structures. The new Group Details page in the MIS means that making these changes is quicker and easier than before.A consistent naming convention is a necessary condition for effective analysis in MAT Vision but not a sufficient one. Two teachers can use the same form to describe a Prediction, in Maths, in Year 11 in Autumn of grade 5 – but the underlying realities they are describing with those two judgments could still be wildly different.Technology can only play a limited role in solving this dilemma. However, it’s important to raise here because for many trusts the process of getting data, any data, in a collated form has been so torturous that it can feel like the end of a journey. We would be doing our customers if we presented MAT Vision as a short cut to that destination. Easily collating teacher judgments from across the trust is not the end of a process but the beginning, as those judgments must be checked and calibrated before they can be relied upon to provide meaningful information.~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi/bromcomcomputersplc-1119791.bromcom-mat-vision-primary-schools-analytics?tab=Overview~bromcomcomputersplc-1119791.bromcom-mat-vision-primary-schools-analytics

If you have a multimodal distribution (multiple peaks) or some confusion as to where things are clustered then it's not easy to figure this out.A kernel density plot helps with this challenge by showing the variations in your data across its distribution. It works like a histogram, but uses kernel smoothing to provide a smoother curve where noise might otherwise be present.This visual provides you with the ability to make these violin plots, with the option of displaying an accompanying combo plot (either a box plot, barcode plot or column plot).Features include:<ul><li>Split and color by categories</li></ul><ul><li>4 different kernels</li></ul><ul><li>Sampling resolution</li></ul><ul><li>Estimated/manual KDE bandwidth, configurable by category</li></ul><ul><li>Customizable combo plot (box, barcode or column)</li></ul>Please refer to the example .pbix file, or the wiki at http://bit.ly/violin-plot for more details.----------------------------------------What's new in 1.3.0:----------------------------------------<ul><li>Revised legend</li></ul><ul><li>Additional column (min/max) combo plot</li></ul><ul><li>Option to clamp the plot to min/max values</li></ul><ul><li>Start and End values for the y-axis</li></ul><ul><li>Addition of the # Samples with Highlighted Value on the barcode combo plot default tooltip</li></ul><ul><li>Violin stroke width can be set to 0</li></ul>Changes are document more fully at http://bit.ly/violin-1_3----------------------------------------What's new in 1.2.0:----------------------------------------<ul><li>Added 'show data' hotkey (Alt + Shift + F11) accessibility support</li></ul><ul><li>Locale awareness for measures and Y-axis</li></ul><ul><li>Improved tooltip functionality, including report page tooltips and recently introduced tooltip formatting changes</li></ul><ul><li>Bug fixes</li></ul>More detailed release notes can be viewed at https://bit.ly/2CpYv8w----------------------------------------What's new in 1.1.0:----------------------------------------<ul><li>Added barcode plot as an alternative to box plot</li></ul><ul><li>KDE bandwidth can be applied by category, rather than uniformly</li></ul><ul><li>Minor bug fixes</li></ul>~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can read and make changes to your document</li><li>Can send data over the Internet</li>~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA104381947?tab=Overview~WA104381947

Atidot works with leading companies to discover under-insurance for up-sell and cross-sell opportunities as well as predict insurance behavior of customers such as lapse, surrender, option taking and premium persistency.Our technology is used by two core groups within the company:-	Customer engagement opportunities are managed by either sales, marketing or distribution, as well as customer service. Atidot’s solution predicts customers’ probability to be under-insured, propensity to lapse or surrender and feeds the agent or the direct to consumer solution with the right insight regarding the customer. For example, providing the agent with leads from their book of business on specific customers with actionable insights for outreach.-	Improvement of projection accuracy – Using Atidot, the company can generate much more accurate customer segmentation for financial projections resulting in reduction of volatility in projection, improvement of assumption, smarter segmentation for product development and pricing.Atidot’s solution sits on top of existing technology seamlessly. Our cloud based infrastructure uses API architecture that helps us integrate with core-systems, admin systems, CRMs and data warehouses and lakes.The solution is cloud based and is consumed as a SaaS solution, leveraging the scalability, redundancy, efficiency, security and privacy of the cloud environment.Our solution is based on a `Docker`/`Nix` container architecture in Azure, where pipelines of microservices form and run. Microservices include: ‘Atidot Data Tool’ for insurance-aware auto-tagging of semi-structured / raw data (using probabilistic algorithms and Deep-Neural-Networks), ‘Atidot Arena’ - running multiple machine-learning algorithms simultaneously in the search for the best predictor, ‘Atidot Storage’ - storage abstraction layer on top of CosmosDB, Blob storage, Data Lake. To orchestrate this, we have developed the `Atidot LIA` - a domain specific programming `Language for Insurance and Actuaries`. `LIA` (embedded in the `Haskell` programming language) lets actuaries, data-scientists and BI specialists program very concise actuarial scenarios. With `LIA`, teams focus on solving insurance problems, unconcerned by the numerous technicalities involved in data-science in practice (cloud, elasticity, devops, etc.).   `LIA`'s underlying execution engines take care of that, firing containerized microservices in Azure.This unique technology is monetizing the vertical approach where insurance domain expertise is embedded to the model from the data discovery, based on proprietary insurance data layout, to the models that are built in an insurance specific way. Moreover, our LIA DSL provides industry level benchmarks for insurance behavior of policies based on the unique combination of internal and external data.~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/atidot.atidot_insights?tab=Overview~atidot.atidot_insights
