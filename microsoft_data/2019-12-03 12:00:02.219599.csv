UNLSH differentiates itself by being the ONLY platform with the following features:<ul><li><strong>Data Source Vendor Agnostic:</strong> Solves the problem of data-lock-in. It unleashes all IT-OT data and makes it available through open API.</li><li><strong>Leverage and Liberate:</strong> UNLSH not only leverages all IT and OT data sources, it can leverage specialized models (predictive maintenance algorithm), specialized applications (e.g. MATLAB, Simulink, any LP tool, etc.). It leverages and liberates isolated data islands, application islands and isolated analytics islands.</li><li><strong>Contextualization:</strong> UNLSH contextualizes both data (tabular, time-series) and all its derivatives (derived out of engineering analytics, business analytics, machine learning algorithms, etc.) through a unique digital twin mechanism. This allows cross functional cognition of all events, exceptions, anomalies and excursions.</li><li><strong>No-Code:</strong> UNLSH is Graphical Configuration driven at every step - data ingestion, fusion, analytics, digital twin building, etc. This eliminates the IT complexity and dependency on specialized IT skillsets for any digitalization initiative, reducing risks involved and time-to-value by 80%.</li></ul>A distinctive differentiator of UNLSH is that it <b>quantifies economic impact of ALL deviations and excursions,</b> be it overdue receivables or excess oxygen in furnaces, allowing users to prioritize actions from clear economic perspectives. This drives major reduction in Lost Profit-Opportunities (LPO) and continuous improvements of all Key Operating Parameters (KOP) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) across the enterprise.

The measurements from these devices are then sent to a mobile device via Bluetooth - where they feed into our back-end data analytics solution.<b>ARMED’s mission is simple:</b><i>“To provide technology enabled care solutions which empower people to remain independent in their home for longer.”</i>ARMED was developed in recognition of the growing importance of prevention and self-management. Capturing data from an individual and their home environment and combining with powerful machine learning allows changes to be identified so that action can be taken.Data from the wearables can be combined with various other data feeds, with some of our other pilot sites choosing to combine information from the wearable technologies with social care data such as quantitative electronic call monitoring information, qualitative wellbeing information, qualitative assessment information and Service User feedback. Once in our back-end analytics solution, ARMED triangulates all of the data captured to create a 'risk profile' for each Service User, correlating their health metrics over any given period of time, so the Council will be able to identify a health decline in a Service User - before a health event happens and interventative care is required. ARMED focuses on highlighting risk in individuals with complex needs, so that care can be focused in the areas where it truly needs to be, with less staff / resource required.  ARMED brings benefits to individuals and their families, Care Providers and the wider community. By encouraging self-management and identifying at-risk individuals sooner, there is potential to save millions of pounds from the public purse.Additionally, it is acknowledged as to the importance of Housing is now recognised as an important part of someone’s wellbeing - alongside their care and support.  Monitoring various aspects of the home environment has benefits for the individual and the housing provider. Earlier intervention to issues within a property will provide for an improved tenant experience as well as reduce the reactive costs, allow strategic decisions regarding budget &amp; resourcing priorities and positively increase the longevity of the building fabric.  Data captured from environmental based sensors, collected via low power, long range networks such as LoRa facilitates a cost-effective manner for collecting data.

Banks are responsible for cash existence in the ATM to serve both their customers and the customers of other banks.  Managing this operation is both costly and difficult to handle.   Loading ATMs with unnecessarily high volume of money increases the customer service level but at the same time increases cash holding cost.

In addition replenishing ATMs with cash has huge operational cost that is the result of cash transportation with armed trucks.   inter-ATM/Optimizer is designed by considering all of the cost and service related factors.  inter-ATM/Optimizer monitors the cash levels in all of the ATMs,  determines cash checkout behaviors for each ATMs by using advance statistical forecast techniques and algorithms designed and owned by Intertech.inter-ATM/Optimizer analyzes the historical behavior of each ATMs and determines the optimal service level and cash replenishment schedule for each ATMs.  By this way, both replenishment cost and cash holding costs are minimized and ATM service level is maximized.inter-ATM/Optimizer can be bundled with Inter Router, a standalone system that optimally determines the routes of cash distribution trucks.  By bundling inter-ATM/Optimizer with Inter Router you can decrease the replenishment cost of ATMs.  In addition, the truck capacity can be used more effectively and this brings savings both on personnel cost and truck investment costs. ~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/intertech_bilgi.int-atmopt01?tab=Overview~intertech_bilgi.int-atmopt01

Such measurements are required for regulatory, health and safety reasons, and correct monitoring can mean the difference between life and death as well as commercial success. Our full stack, plug and play solution consists of sensors that record temperatures in real time, cloud data storage and integrated web and mobile apps for reporting and analytics. Sensee can be instantly deployed at a fraction of the cost of competitor solutions with RoI immediately visible to business owners and managers.<strong>Industry Challenge:</strong>Products such as fresh and frozen food, drugs, vaccines and blood samples are extremely sensitive to temperature with products easily spoiling or experiencing quality degradation.  Strict national and international regulations exist to ensure the correct processes are carried out at all stages in the manufacturing, distribution, preparation and handling of such perishable goods. Improper temperature monitoring is responsible for up to 3,000 deaths and 120,000 hospitalizations each year in the US alone as well as the loss of up to 20% of all food produced each year globally in an $8 trillion industry. Similarly, it is estimated that up to 30% of all drugs and vaccines in the pharmaceutical industry are lost due to temperature excursions at some stage in their manufacturing and distribution.

Above all, tolerance limits on produced components are very tight.Due to instabilities in industrial processes, scrap parts are repeatedly produced. For this reason, each component must be visually inspected. Of course, this is very time and resource intensiveSolutionThis product uses images from industrial cameras and detects defects on components. It processes images in real-time and classifies between good parts and bad parts. Furthermore, the system can also learn different types of defects to classify even more accurate between types.USPThree things that distinguishes this product from existing solutions:<ul><li><b>Easy scalable -</b> The system does not need to be configured with tolerance limits of parts. Instead it uses a couple labeled images (good parts / bad parts) and learns the tolerances itself. This way the solution can be adopted to new parts or different production lines very fast.</li><li><b>Few labeled images</b> - The solution uses a semi-supervised learning approach, meaning that in the core it uses an anomaly detection approach to identify abnormalities. On top it uses some human labeled images to validate the anomalies. </li><li><b>Visualizing defects</b> -  Classifying in real-time is the core functionality but the product is also able to visualize the defect on the image. So process engineers can faster inspect the images to stabilize their process.</li></ul>The solution supports Azure IoT Services and is currently only available in German.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/craftworks.anomaly-detection-for-machine-vision?tab=Overview~craftworks.anomaly-detection-for-machine-vision

Are you a wholesaler with an extensive item database, and do you have a hard time keeping up with the suppliers price-updates? And even though you import the new prices on a regular base, you are still unsure if a price in a sales document is up to date? Let our Tech Trade Essentials app do assist you on these recurring tasks, so you can concentrate on what you do best!</em>With a large portfolio, maintenance of your items can be a time consuming task. Using Excel-based imports can be a time consuming task, and a small mistake can have a large impact. Excel is a great tool, and it is smart, but it can be a bit too smart. Chances are that number formats are incorrectly interpreted, causing wrong prices in your price lists. By saving the price list as a csv-file and import the csv file, you have two advantages: no more formatting issues, and a much, much shorter waiting time when you import 10-thousands of records. Missing items will be created and existing items updated. New price records will be generated and old prices records will receive an end date.When you create sales documents, sometimes you are in doubt if the price displayed is up-to date. With Tech Trade Essentials app, this is all history. When the applied sales price is older than a certain period (from setup), the price is displayed in a red font, so you can contact your supplier to check whether your price info is still up to date.If a user changes the price, or the line discount, the system will store the original price and discount as calculated by Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and it will flag the sales line as well as the entire order with a “Manual Price” checkmark. This enables a user to set a filter on sales documents with manually changed prices/discounts. This helps you to accelerate the invoice process, as you only have to check the documents with the “manual price” flag!<strong>Features and benefits</strong><ul><li> Import items and create purchase and sales prices in one run</li><li> Close old price agreements</li><li> Flag sales documents with changed prices or discounts</li><li> Store the primary calculated price and discount in the sales lines</li><li> Mark old sales prices in sales documents </li></ul>Do you want to work more efficient?Just click on the "GET IT NOW" button and try the App <strong>Tech Trade Essentials</strong> for <strong>free</strong>.Or visit our <a href=" https://www.wsb-solutions.nl/apps/tech-trade-essentials/ ">product website.</a>This app supports both the Essential and Premium editions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.Supported CountriesUSA, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Danmark, UK, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365-business-central/PUBID.wsb_solutions|AID.techtrade_essentials|PAPPID.df08c68b-7647-4c94-a316-3335a52689ff?tab=Overview~PUBID.wsb_solutions|AID.techtrade_essentials|PAPPID.df08c68b-7647-4c94-a316-3335a52689ff

The advent of API accessed mapping software such as Open Street, Google, MapQuest, etc., has revolutionized the way we use maps. A similar change is on its way as it relates to location based data.Currently, app developers whether they be individuals or corporations manage GPS data generated by their solutions themselves.

Indexing, storage, retrieval and real-time analytics and decisioning consume a lot of resources and require considerable expertise to manage the impact on system performance. Performance optimizations and scaling are huge challenges. The costs can really add up. Logistrics offers a specialized “GPS data as a Service” that can handle the large volumes of GPS data, index, store and allow for optimal retrieval, provide real-time analytics that can be used within apps (after all it’s the analytics that matters not the data itself) and offers value adds such as scheduling, queuing, auto-dispatch etc., based on the data analyzed.Logistrics Services (<a href="https://www.logistricsservices.com">www.logistricsservices.com</a>) is the first of this kind of service and offers API’s, libraries and tools to integrate location data and obtain insights and analytics in real-time that can help drive decisions within your apps.We offer a free 14-day trial.

This App upgrades that to include other devices through the Dynamics 365 web interface. <b>Print License Plates with No Additional Movements</b>This feature allows users to create and print a new license plate label on demand without having to waste time processing an unnecessary inventory movement. <b>Automatically Update Product Receipt After PO Work is Complete</b>This update allows a user to bypass the manual receipt of a purchase order, automating the product receipt when inventory is put away and all other work related to a purchase order is complete. This time-saving feature includes the ability to capture the packing slip number if required. <b>Post Packing Slip in Same Run as Shipment Confirmation</b>Properly posting and printing a packing slip once pick work is complete has never been possible in standard Dynamics 365. This feature allows companies to post a packing slip for a shipment in the same run as a shipment confirmation as soon as all outbound work is completed. This also includes optional Packing slips printed through the work audit template. <b>Batch Release to Warehouse for Reserved Ordered Quantities</b>Distributors currently cannot create a shipment only for reserve ordered quantities. This feature allows companies to release to warehouse for reserved ordered and physical reserved in a batch. <b>Release to Warehouse from Sales Orders and Transfer Orders Forms without Setting a Reserved Quantity</b>Standard Dynamics 365 requires the inventory quantity to be physically reserved when released to warehouse. To automatically release to the warehouse, you must go outside of the standard sales order and transfer order forms. This feature removes a step and allows the user to do everything from the sales order or transfer order form without a set reserved quantity. <b>Confirm Shipment from Wave/Sales Order/Transfer Order</b>This feature reduces the number of clicks required to confirm a shipment by allowing the user to do it directly from wave details, sales orders and transfer orders.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365-for-finance-and-operations/enavate.warehouse_extensions?tab=Overview~enavate.warehouse_extensions

On the other side of the platform are local governments and collectors, to which we offer the Smart Operations platform. Where they get real time monitoring of the current status of their waste collection network. With it they could also influence citizens and dynamics of the city in a positive way, by for example; citizens could check for "Which garbage bin is pain more GreenYngs today?",  promoted by local government , offering more points at particular time by taking their recycling material to other garbage bin a bit farther in distance but that is more empty. Another example could be that local governments would be able to launch special offers to exchange GreenYngs worth more if the citizen buys on local shops or a particular high street they want to promote. Of course, in smart operation it is implicit the possibility to do real time monitoring of the network of containers in order to improve collection routes.

Boost your effectiveness by managing how you come across to other people.~You are very busy. To be effective, your choice of words is important.You wonder how an email was so misunderstood by the recipient and perfectly clear to you. Part of the reason is that your readers are responding to the tone and style of your email, not only its contents. RiteTone boosts your effectiveness by helping you:<ul><li>Never again get an unexpected reaction to your email because your words were not interpreted as you intended.</li></ul><ul><li>Increase your "approval rating" with your email readers</li></ul><ul><li>Increase your reader's satisfaction with the email exchange</li></ul>Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and manage your own emotions and influence the emotions of others. It is generally said to include three skills: emotional awareness; the ability to harness emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes regulating your own emotions and influencing the emotions in other people. RiteTone Emotional Intelligence helps you increase your emotional intelligence in email conversations. RiteTone does this by using linguistic analysis to detect two key aspects of any conversation: emotional tone and language style.  RiteTone does this by providing you quantified feedback across the following tones and styles: Emotional:<ul><li> Joy - A sense of well-being, inner peace, love, safety and contentment. </li></ul><ul><li> Fear - A response to impending danger. A survival mechanism that is a reaction to some negative stimulus.</li></ul><ul><li> Sadness - A feeling of loss and disadvantage.</li></ul><ul><li> Disgust - An emotional response of revulsion to something considered offensive or unpleasant.</li></ul><ul><li> Anger - Evoked due to injustice, conflict, humiliation, negligence or betrayal.</li></ul> Language:<ul><li> Analytic – A higher score is more likely to be perceived as intellectual, rational, systematic, emotionless, or impersonal.</li></ul><ul><li> Confidence – A higher score is more likely to be perceived as assured, collected, hopeful, or egotistical.</li></ul><ul><li> Tentative – A higher score is more likely to be perceived as questionable, doubtful, limited, or debatable.</li></ul>Research has found that the other person will be more satisfied with your reply to questions when you express: <ul><li>More confidence</li></ul><ul><li>Less tentativeness</li></ul><ul><li>Less anger</li></ul>As well, you are more likely to find approval with your audience when you express:<ul><li>Less sadness</li></ul><ul><li>More emotions</li></ul><ul><li>More joy</li></ul> For more information, visit our web site: https://www.ritetone.com/.RiteTone is password protected, but does not require you to login to any other accounts.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can send data over the Internet</li><li>This add-in can access and modify personal information in the active message, such as the body, subject, sender, recipients, and attachment information.

You can design an interactive dashboard using the familiar environment of Excel, and then publish your dashboard to a variety of formats including PowerPoint, web and mobile devices.When you embed your dashboard in a PowerPoint presentation, you can interact with live data, drill down for further analysis and create a more engaging experience for your audience.  Create beautiful reports using compelling visuals such as:<ul><li>Charts</li></ul><ul><li>Maps</li></ul><ul><li>Tree Maps</li></ul><ul><li>Pivot Grids</li></ul><ul><li>Gauges</li></ul><ul><li>Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</li></ul>The key differentiator for Chartnado is that you can build your dashboard in Excel.  Most dashboard builders require you to migrate your data into a database, learn a new formula language for calculations.  That’s a lot of work just to put an interactive chart into PowerPoint.  With Chartnado, you can take full advantage of the Excel features you already know and love, including familiar formulas, Power Query, VBA and more.For more information, please visit www.chartnado.com or email us at info@chartnado.com~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can read and make changes to your document</li><li>Can send data over the Internet</li>~['Work or school account', 'Microsoft account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380948?tab=Overview~WA104380948

UBIRCH's <b><i>Blockchain for Things</i></b> enables the creation of 100% trustworthy records for data-dependent business models – whenever and wherever accuracy, integrity or authenticity is essential.The UBIRCH protocol 'seals' data packets right on the edge device applying hard cryptography. Undetected manipulation, deletion or duplication of data packets is impossible after this sealing process – even, when the data is transmitted over unsecured com channels. Additionally each data packet can be attributed without doubt to a unique originating device. Finally, each data packet is anchored in a high-bandwidth, two-stage blockchain setup.The end result ist a 100% trustworthy, immutable set of records.The product comes in the form of 3 modules <ol><li>a firmware library running on the edge device </li><li>a cloud-based service (on Azure) for anchoring the data in a blockchain and integrity check of data packets from secured sensors</li><li>optionally a verification service running on premise in the client's data center or cloud</li></ol>Privacy and TrustEven though an important aspect of UBIRCH on Azure is an immutable blockchain, you can implement GDPR-compliant applications utilizing the ubirch protocol. Additionally, you don't have to trust us with your data. The UBIRCH protocol effectively consists of an envelope for the data transmission. This envelope “seals” and secures the payload it contains. The envelope is a conceptional one, though. In the actually data being exchanged between the sender and receiver, payload and envelope do not have to be transmitted together or in the same channel. In many applications it might be desirable (and is supported), to transmit the payload and the envelope/seal separately. This is accomplished by using a cryptographic hash function to create a digest of the original data packet and only transmitting the digest as the payload within the ubirch protocol envelope.Separating data and cryptographic seal enables customers to integrate the ubirch trust infrastructure without touching the original data pipeline.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/ubirch.ubirch_on_azure?tab=Overview~ubirch.ubirch_on_azure

['Health', 'Professional services']~['Web Apps']~['Collaboration', 'Finance']~Aico Group Oy~2019 R1~NA~Aico Account Reconciliation~0~NA~With automation you can free up to 80% of the time you current spend on reconciling accounts~What if you could create balance sheet specifications automatically when you choose, and using the data you choose?Aico Account Reconciliation automates the preparation and review of accounts during the reconciliation process. These features support the employees involved in the reconciliation process and introduces consistency in the reconciliation process and control over who does what and when, making it easier to prioritize the reconciliations.Typically, data to be reconciled is manually added to excel spreadsheets and this is done for all General Ledger (GL) accounts. Aico automates this work by connecting to data in the ERP through integration and by running that data through predefined auto-reconciliation rules. Only the accounts that do not pass rules are sent to be reconciled to responsible people in the workflow.To help you reconcile the accounts that do require your attention, Aico provides you with support for multi-phase approval workflows, real-time monitoring and dashboards through which you can drill-down directly into the underlying data. Remediation actions take place and propagate in real time, so you don't have to wait for the next data upload, and can continue work within seconds of posting. <b>Dashboards</b>Easily monitor the status of all account reconciliation tasks - who is responsible for them and whether they are late, sort tasks by priority, risk, company code, and the assigned user. This makes the entire process highly visible for different stakeholders, such as the reconcilers themselves, financial controllers, shared service center managers, business partners, internal auditors, and external auditors.<b>Action log</b> The action log tracks all events that have occurred in Aico Account Reconciliation. You can view a history of the changes made to each document, track the document workflow and see all actions performed by users and the system. Comments and attachments can also be added to a specific action<b>Automatic reconciliation rules</b>You can use configurable automatic reconciliation rules to allow accounts to be reconciled automatically by Aico. This can happen, for example, when the closing balance or variance over the prior period is below a defined amount. These rules can be also be used to check the number, age, and value of individual line items.<b>Copying prior period data</b>You can carry forward line items or reconciling items and their associated supporting explanations from a prior period.<b>Automatic data extracts from ERP</b>Connect to and pull data directly in real time from the underlying ERP system or systems without any need for exporting files.<b>Archiving</b>Completed documents are automatically moved to the "Waiting for Archiving" status and later archived. All transactions recorded to documents are saved in a format that meets legislative requirements. ~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/aico-group-oy-5323624.aicoaccrec2019?tab=Overview~aico-group-oy-5323624.aicoaccrec2019

It can acquire a bright-field scan of an entire well plate within 5 minutes and provides instant confluency analysis of your cultures.CytoSMART envisions “a world in which diseases are addressed in an accelerated pace, through live‐cell imaging research that is fully automated, time effective, affordable with the ability for continuous sample tracking and analysis”.Its mission is “to offer affordable products to every mainstream laboratory by leveraging advanced cloud‐based that obtain superior results by using artificial intelligence solutions that are robust against hardware imperfections".For many years, researchers in labs have conducted experiments by using indirect techniques, for example, the Alamar blue assay technique. Indirect methods add a substance to the cell cultures that highlights some of them. When the cells turn purple, the intensity of the reaction on the substance is visualized by a light or dark purple. However, this technique has a disadvantage. When there are two cells with completely different situations, they could both react to the substance with the same intensity. Therefore, it is not a very reliable method. In addition, the sample will be useless because of the added substance. To replace the indirect technique, CytoSMART has developed the CytoSMART Omni. This product conducts a live‐cell analysis of cell cultures inside any incubator. It is a small and affordable product that offers a stable environment for cell cultures. This revolutionary device needs less equipment and offers high quality for a relatively low price. Furthermore, the CytoSMART Omni is a live‐cell analysis, so it does not use substances that lead to unreliable results and influenced samples.Life science is about studying living organisms. Yet most life science microscopes cannot look at effects over time. The development of microscopes has been held back by the need to process unprecedented amounts of data automated microscopes produce.Therefore, CytoSMART uses Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence in the Azure Cloud.The market can be divided into four segments.

It enables full transparency on all parameters for <b>drives, motors, mounted bearings and pumps</b>, and can also be applied to applications such as compressors, conveyors, mixers and extruder main shafts. Users can digitally “see” operational variables and health indicators through an integrated, one-stop portal – including availability, environmental conditions and fault events.Connected drives, motors, bearings and pumps provide data for advanced monitoring and analytics to improve- the performance - reliability - efficiencySafety for discrete industries: safety is critical to discrete industries such as the food and beverage and logistics sectors. A malfunction or mechanical problems in an application may cause a serious safety hazard for the machine and for employees. With ABB solution production managers and operators can identify malfunctions via the monitoring portal, remotely, to support safe operations.Reliability for process industries: process industries, such as mining, oil and gas, metals and pulp &amp; paper need to ensure 24/7 reliability of their operations. A process failure in any of these industries can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in unplanned downtime. Global mining company, Glencore, has been using the ABB Ability™ Digital Powertrain to have a broader view of equipment monitoring:“We use the condition monitoring service for powertrains in the seawater pumps system, that distributes cooling water in our factory. It is a critical part of the process, and we already have a monitoring solution for the pumps and motors connected to the control system but not remote monitoring for drives,” says Sigurd Bjerland, Maintenance Electrical Engineer at Glencore Nikkelverk. “The integration of ABB Ability™ gives us the possibility to collect more information on the cooling status of the drives and compare data coming from the two monitoring solutions. It is beneficial to be able to see the condition of our equipment online.”Efficiency for infrastructure: ABB Ability™ Digital Powertrain condition monitoring solutions are successfully used in cooling, heating, water and other building applications. The Swedish water utility company Uppsala Vatten och Avfall uses the solution so that its plant operators receive reports on real-time indicators like reliability, usage patterns, power consumption and stress levels. These are updated and accessible at any time. ABB specialists can analyze the equipment, for example to understand the impact of the environment on specific components. The key element in advanced analytics and maintenance planning for motors, pumps and mounted bearings is ABB Ability™ Smart Sensor, converting powertrain elements into smart, wirelessly connected IoT-devices.   ~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/abb-3963258.condition-monitoring-motors-drives-pumps?tab=Overview~abb-3963258.condition-monitoring-motors-drives-pumps

The solution is of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry due to the growing problem of counterfeiting- affecting both patient lives and revenue losses to the pharmaceutical companies along with the mandate to comply with the Falsified Medicines Directive. The solution focuses on the following key applications:•	Track and trace of prescription medicines:The use case uses the unique serialization number of each package to track it along the entire supply chain, across the stakeholders using the PharmaTrace solution.  Counterfeits are detected by alert flags raised by the system on scanning of the fake drug barcode. . A real time verification and validation of registered assets  with the regulator’s database thereby ensures robust leakage detection and control mechanism•	Saleable Returns / EMVS Verification: The verification of serialisation data at one or more stops along the supply chain is the next step in the EU FMD. After the manufacturers have generated the serialisation data, they must report the product master and production data to a centralised hub, known as the European Medicines Verification System (EMVS) and forwards all data to the respective National Systems. Channel partners have 10 days before they can add drugs back into the EMVS for reselling. PharmaTrace provides real time, secure verification of the product returned by the pharmacy to the distributor/wholesaler. PharmaTrace provides interoperability so that wholesalers and distributors can easily verify barcodes with the database and flags as well as logs transactions that are suspicious.•	Condition monitoring: The PharmaTrace blockchain platform is capable of interacting with the condition monitoring IoT device placed in the cold storage containers- large cold storages, refrigerators, vehicles, etc.  This use case is relevant for drugs that need to be stored under prescribed temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. E.g. Vaccines, photosensitive drugs. In case of any breaches, PharmaTrace’s autonomous agents raise flags, log into the system and reports it to the relevant stakeholders. The in-built track and trace mechanism then allows removal of spoiled medicines from the supply chain system.•	Certificate management: The use case ensures digitization of compliance certificates and supply chain documents like invoices, e-bill of lading, title of ownership, customs clearances, bank letters of credit etc., along with selective sharing of digital assets with relevant stakeholders like Pharma Company, distributors wholesalers and dispensers for compliance and completeness of the process. The benefits are seamless process optimization and faster payment cycles solves the problem of inefficiencies, forgery and large account receivables.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/bosch.rbei_pharma_trace?tab=Overview~bosch.rbei_pharma_trace

Using data entities allows you to ensure the integrity of information when extracting and inserting data.In most cases, viewing and manipulating data is done in forms, so copying and pasting functions are added to the OPTION system menu, which is present on almost all forms.When copying data, the source is the records of the tables present on the form where the copy function was started. When data is inserted, the data entity where the insertion will be performed (the recipient) is selected from those that are present on the form in which the operation was started. In order for the data insertion operation to be performed, it is necessary to pre-configure the mapping of the source-entity fields to the fields of the recipient entity.### The data source can also be: • predefined values (constants);  • information from data source records present on the form where the insert function was initiated;  • the automatically generated value of the number sequence associated with the destination field.So, you can configure a lot of data copying scenarios if there are relevant data entities in the system. In this case, there is no need to develop the data copying function - it is enough for an expert to set up a mapping map between entity fields. To facilitate the settings, the function of automatic matching of fields by data types and the function of checking the fields of the recipient entity are created.~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365-for-finance-and-operations/smart-businessllc2412077-2412077.smartcopytoolforoperationssb?tab=Overview~smart-businessllc2412077-2412077.smartcopytoolforoperationssb

The communication validates that the consignment is in line with the carrier agreement avoiding additional charges.Use different carriers – in the same wayOne of the main ideas with LogTrade Connect is to be able to use different carriers when you ship, depending on goods size, destinations, customers etc. You can have different agreements for different carriers, or your customer may want you to ship on their agreement. This normally means that you have to integrate several carriers in your ERP, or that you need to work manually on the their booking web sites. With LogTrade Connect you have one single integration point regardless of carrier.FunctionalityWith LogTrade Connect you can easily interact directly from all processes in Dynamics where you handle items; no needs to enter data twice. You can use additional carrier services such as advice, heat, cold, timed deliveries etc. If you deliver several orders in the same shipment you can consolidate them automatically to keep the freight cost down. With different settings it is also possible to automatically calculate correct freight price, create customs invoices and dangerous goods information calculated automatically based on the items shipped. Labels are printed automatically and the electronic information to the carrier is also transferred automatically. The tracking number is saved on the shipped document to make it easy to track directly from Dynamics 365 Business Central.Supported carriersFor each country there is a carrier package with the most common carriers for that country with possibility to add more carriers to your specific license. Example of carriers that can be used in different countries are:<ul><li>Best</li><li>Bring</li><li>BudBee</li><li>Dachser</li><li>Danske Fragtmaend</li><li>DB Schenker</li><li>DHL</li><li>DPD</li><li>DSV Road</li><li>FedEx</li><li>GLS</li><li>PostNord</li><li>TNT</li><li>UPS</li></ul>A generic carrier module is included that can be used for your own logistic services or carriers not natively supported by LogTrade.

Solve your model in the cloud.Solver models that you may already have, created in old or new versions of Microsoft Excel, are automatically recognized by this Solver add-in. You can also define a completely new Solver model and solve it using this add-in; however, models created with this new Solver add-in won’t be recognized automatically by the desktop Excel Solver.You can use this Solver add-in to find better ways to allocate scarce resources, maximize profits or minimize costs or risks, in a wide range of applications in finance and investment, marketing, manufacturing and production, distribution and logistics, purchasing, and human resources, as well as science and engineering. To see examples, open the SolvSamp.xlsx workbook included in Microsoft Excel, or register at www.solver.com and click on Examples to download dozens more example models. Many management science textbooks also include examples and discussions of Solver models: see Support - Recommended Books on Solver.com.All the solving methods and options available in the Excel Solver can be used:- Simplex LP Solver - GRG Nonlinear Solver - Evolutionary Solver - Integer and binary constraints For a complete description, visit www.solver.com/excel-solver-help. You can create an Answer Report and/or a Sensitivity Report in Excel 2016, and soon in Excel Online or Excel on iPad, as long as Solver finds a feasible solution.  But since VBA is not available online, Solver VBA macros cannot be used to control this Solver add-in.For free use by everyone, problem size limits in this Solver add-in are the same as in the Excel Solver (200 decision variables and 100 constraints in addition to bounds on the variables). Limits on Solver subproblems and iterations operate just as they do in the Excel Solver, but the backend server currently limits solving time to 30 seconds.  If you are using Frontline’s enhanced Solvers for desktop Excel and you ‘publish’ your model to Excel Online, you can solve much larger problems, use additional Solver engines and options, and use more solving time with this add-in, up to the limits of your desktop license.When you click the Solve button in the add-in, your model is queued for solution by Frontline’s backend RASON Server, running on Windows Azure. Usually solutions are available in seconds, but during periods of heavy use, there may be delays in solving.

Yet asset-intensive industries face a fundamental challenge converting their asset data into analytics. Asset data is stored in silos across many production sites and systems, out of reach for most data consumers. Simply consolidating asset data in a data lake doesn’t solve the problem because without context you can’t find all the operational signals in the data. Modeling asset data to build that context is challenging because of the complex structure and semantics of asset data, especially sensor data. Element AssetHub™ eliminates the data challenges holding back analytics with an all-in-one solution that integrates, harmonizes, and contextualizes your asset data. AssetHub is a multi-faceted solution to connect disparate asset data sources, manage data modeling through Asset Twins (the dynamic digital representations of physical assets), and share common data models and asset data for easy consumption across  the enterprise. AssetHub is delivered on a modern cloud-native architecture to overcome the integration, data modeling, and persistence challenges inherent in utilizing asset data for advanced industrial analytics.  AssetHub unlocks your asset data, providing a 360° view of every asset, enabling advanced analytical and AI applications.AssetHub’s architecture supports hybrid data connectivity to data sources of any type, whether on-premise or cloud-based.

While sales booking numbers are important, we often miss the fact that the deal closure is the first step in a long and tedious road to delivering on the promises and collection of dues. While organizations invest in state-of-the-art sales and accounting tools when it comes to managing collections most organizations rely on manual effort. As a result, a significant process gap exists between the Booking, Billing and Collection (the BBC gap, as we call it) which if not addressed, results in poor organizational performance, inter-departmental frictions and more importantly, poor customer relationship.The collection management solution from C Centric is designed to address all these issues. It automates the collection process, ensures timely communication with customers, provides a platform of collaboration between all stakeholders- the accounts and back office, sales, delivery, customer and partners, monitors the process every step of the way and automatically escalate deviations.

Boost your effectiveness by managing how you come across to other people.~You are very busy. To be effective, your choice of words is important.You wonder how an email was so misunderstood by the recipient and perfectly clear to you. Part of the reason is that your readers are responding to the tone and style of your email, not only its contents. RiteTone boosts your effectiveness by helping you:<ul><li>Never again get an unexpected reaction to your email because your words were not interpreted as you intended.</li></ul><ul><li>Increase your "approval rating" with your email readers</li></ul><ul><li>Increase your reader's satisfaction with the email exchange</li></ul>Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and manage your own emotions and influence the emotions of others. It is generally said to include three skills: emotional awareness; the ability to harness emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes regulating your own emotions and influencing the emotions in other people. RiteTone Emotional Intelligence helps you increase your emotional intelligence in email conversations. RiteTone does this by using linguistic analysis to detect two key aspects of any conversation: emotional tone and language style.  RiteTone does this by providing you quantified feedback across the following tones and styles: Emotional:<ul><li> Joy - A sense of well-being, inner peace, love, safety and contentment. </li></ul><ul><li> Fear - A response to impending danger. A survival mechanism that is a reaction to some negative stimulus.</li></ul><ul><li> Sadness - A feeling of loss and disadvantage.</li></ul><ul><li> Disgust - An emotional response of revulsion to something considered offensive or unpleasant.</li></ul><ul><li> Anger - Evoked due to injustice, conflict, humiliation, negligence or betrayal.</li></ul> Language:<ul><li> Analytic – A higher score is more likely to be perceived as intellectual, rational, systematic, emotionless, or impersonal.</li></ul><ul><li> Confidence – A higher score is more likely to be perceived as assured, collected, hopeful, or egotistical.</li></ul><ul><li> Tentative – A higher score is more likely to be perceived as questionable, doubtful, limited, or debatable.</li></ul>Research has found that the other person will be more satisfied with your reply to questions when you express: <ul><li>More confidence</li></ul><ul><li>Less tentativeness</li></ul><ul><li>Less anger</li></ul>As well, you are more likely to find approval with your audience when you express:<ul><li>Less sadness</li></ul><ul><li>More emotions</li></ul><ul><li>More joy</li></ul> For more information, visit our web site: https://www.ritetone.com/.RiteTone is password protected, but does not require you to login to any other accounts.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can send data over the Internet</li><li>This add-in can access and modify personal information in the active message, such as the body, subject, sender, recipients, and attachment information.

[]~['Teams']~['Human resources', 'Operations + supply chain', 'Productivity']~Allganize, Inc~1.0.0~10/2/2019~Alli~0~NA~Alli helps business resolve employee's questions automatically by NLU AI~Alli is the easiest tool to deliver rich conversational experiences."Alli helps business automate answering questions from employees and customers by natural language understanding AI. Businesses are having too many documents and getting too many questions from employees and customers. And they are spending too much time for getting an answer from these documents. Alli will resolve this.How Alli is different:You don't need to spend any time for manual data tagging. Just upload your FAQ and documents, such as guidelines, legal documents, contracts and company knowledge documents, in Alli dashboard. All's AI will take care of the rest. Alli's AI will automatically find an answer directly from your FAQ or from your uploaded documents in a sentence level.How it can be possible:Alli is powered by Allganize's Machine Reading Comprehension technology. This is how machine reading comprehension is different from usual keyword search. Let's say you have 100,000 documents and you have one question: "how often should I do onsite exams?" If you put this question in the typical keyword search, you'll probably get around 5,000 documents which contains the word: how, should, or do. You need to check one by one manually. For reading 5,000 documents to check the answer, you will probably need more than an hour.However, if you put the very question in Alli, Allganize's machine reading comprehension API brings the answer in a sentence level such as "12 months is good and it can be extended into 18 months" within a second. So, more than an hour became just a second.What Alli can do:Alli will make you build the multi-turn conversation by using easy-to-use GUI: Chatflow Builder. In Chatflow builder, you can use external data node to integrate with any other 3rd party rest API server or your legacy server. The responses are stored as a variable and can be used in the response to make the personalize conversation.Who are using Alli:Alli has many enterprise customers from US, Japan and South Korea from Insurance, Finance, E-commerce, Energy, Telecommunication industries. Half of Alli customers are using it for the employee assistant and rest of them are for the customer support.This app is used in integration with Alli(https://alli.ai)If you don't have alli account please fill demo request form: https://app.alli.ai/demoIntegration guide: https://blog.allganize.ai/alli-microsoft-teams-integration/This app is not available for independent users, it is an enterprise solution.Purchasing, sign-up and configuration of our app is only possible on enterprise level by IT admins.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can send data over the Internet</li><li>This add-in can access personal information on the active message, such as phone numbers, postal addresses, or URLs.

Tired of bumping into the same people at the office and not knowing their name? We were too, which is why we created MetKnow. Study up! Your next interaction depends on it.Benefits: MetKnow provides a variety of benefits starting with helping co-workers get to know each other. To build a friendship you need to know a few things about someone, beginning with their name.MetKnow reduces turnover in new employees by helping them get to know their new co-workers. When they do get to know everyone, they feel more at home while at work and therefore are less likely to leave.MetKnow creates a more productive workplace. When co-workers are engaging with each other they are sharing ideas and tips. Offices become much more productive with inter-employee collaboration. Managers can build trust and loyalty among their team. Employees tend to feel underappreciated, but if you have a manager who knows your name and cares about your interests, you are more likely to work hard and take pride in your job. MetKnows patented Flashcards (No. 9,330,164) are the most effective way to learn something new, including names, because they engage your brain in 3 ways:Active Recall:Staring at the front of a flashcard engages active recall. This is an attemptto remember the answer rather than staring at it on a sheet. Active recall has beenproven to create stronger neuron connections for that memory trace. And becauseflashcards can so easily facilitate repetition, they are the best way to create multiplememory-enhancing recall events.Flashcards utilize metacognitive faculties:When you reveal the answer side of a flashcard to assess your correctness, you are asking yourself “How did my answercompare to this correct answer?” and “How well did I know (or not know) it?” This act ofself-reflection is known as metacognition. Research shows that applying metacognitiontends to ingrain memories deeper into your knowledge.Confidence-based repetition:Because flashcards exist loosely, rather than tied to abook or document, you are able to separate them into piles based on you need to studythem again. This practice of confidence-based repetition is proven by decades ofresearch to be the most scientifically optimized way to improve memory performance.These make MetKnow the perfect tool for learning about your co-workers and the benefits listed above payback dividends when you see that everyone in your office has become friends.MetKnow is a patented platform (Patent No. 9,330,164) owned by MetKnow Inc.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can send data over the Internet</li><li>This add-in can access personal information on the active message, such as phone numbers, postal addresses, or URLs.

In this mode, the program presents the cards in increasing periods of time. The longer you learn, the less time you spend with each card until you have it memorized. This mode is especially good to train your long-term memory.2.Random mode In this mode the cards are distributed not based on time periods but on probabilities. You can assign a percentage chance to each of the six virtual compartments and the cards appear according to this formula.3.Exam mode BRAINYOO also offers the option to review certain lessons without the usual process of repeating the flashcards. This mode is particularly well suited to learning before exams and tests. The good thing is you can change between the time-based and the lesson-based method anytime you like.

That is Visual Time Tracking.Timesheets do not work! No one likes tracking their time, and especially by recording it on a grid-based timesheet. Current technology solutions have not solved the problem. They still ask us to record time on a digital version of the paper timesheet. We are told just to fill it in. It doesn’t work well. Additionally, TiM provides tools to help capture more of what you do, such as e-mail, phone calls and document work, and automatically place these events into your time calendar. Time tracking will no longer be a chore. TiM is familiar, easy, and just works, all within Microsoft Outlook and your mobile device. TiM is completely integrated into D365 F&amp;O.

It can be used in any country. Any Chart of Accounts can be used to parametrically to map Balance Sheet Accounts and Income Statement Accounts. Percentage of Completion Method adjustments can be made to arrive at IFRS Financial Statements.Construction project budgets can be built and revisions can be made in numerous versions, each version is saved and can be revisited. The budgeting process starts with the determination of the activities and their cost. BOQ (Bill of Quantities) in monetary and physical units are detailed for these activities. Labor cost can be obtained from any payroll software via integration to fill in the predetermined labor cost tables to allocate the labor cost to the appropriate construction activities. Alternatively, labor cost can be filled in manually into the predetermined labor cost tables.Then the construction contract with the employer is used to build the budgeted revenues.Budgeted and Actual costs can be compared. Completed work and remaining work in terms of monetary and physical units can be followed up instantly. The progress payments can be prepared automatically and can be revised instantly.CONSPRO can be fully integrated with PRIMAVERA subject to some customization at both ends.

This is where Document Short Close App comes to rescue. It ensures that such contingencies are managed effortlessly and that too documents-wise and item-wise, both.Few scenarios where Document Short Close could prove as an effective tool are as below.Case 1: A company places an order for 1000 pieces for an item against a vendor. The vendor, considering the quantity available in his inventory, can dispatch only 960 pieces. He would be able to dispatch the remaining 40 items when he has enough inventory. So, the order placed remains pending for a until those 40 items are yet to be received. This might occur for multiple parties too which leads to multiple pending orders. In this scenario, the company may want to close the order and not keep it pending just for those remaining 40 quantities. Document Short Close helps in foreclosing the order of 1000 pieces by creating a negative entry for the outstanding 40 quantities which is yet to be received from the party.Case 2: An Order was placed for various items and the party was not able to dispatch any of the items. So instead of manually foreclosing the individual item, the user can cancel the whole order with the help of Document Short Close app.<strong>Features:</strong><ul><li>Short Closing Pending orders for both Sales and Purchase Orders.</li><li>Specific item wise Short Close for a specific document.</li><li>Document wise Short Close having multiple Items.</li><li>A separate view for Short Closed orders(Purchase/Sales) which bifurcates it from Open orders.</li></ul><strong>Benefits:</strong><ul><li>Reduces manual effort of creating entries to close the pending quantities for specific items</li><li>Accurately tracks outstanding quantities on Purchase or Sales Orders to short close a particular Item’s unfulfilled demand (as that item may be booked for multiple Purchase or Sales orders against different vendors or customers respectively)</li><li>Reduces pending orders within the system which might have been unprocessed for more than stipulated time</li></ul>Try this app now for automating the Short Closing of documents and making the process error-free and seamless.Supported EditionsThis app supports the Essential and Premium editions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business CentralSupported CountriesUnited States~None~['Work or school account']~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365-business-central/PUBID.intechsystems|AID.document_foreclosusre|PAPPID.ec463e62-a303-441d-bb5d-12a14141db19?tab=Overview~PUBID.intechsystems|AID.document_foreclosusre|PAPPID.ec463e62-a303-441d-bb5d-12a14141db19

A clear line of sight of all your contract arrangements enables you to identify wasted spend and areas for consolidation</li><li>Time saved. By reducing the amount of time spent on admin you free up people within your business to focus on other areas that add value. For instance, legal teams can spend more time on activity that requires their expertise rather than basic administration, which doesn’t.</li><li>Risk mitigation. Every business contract can bring with it some level of risk, whether it be legislative, financial or supply chain. By increasing visibility and helping to quantify those risks, Gatekeeper reduces the chance of any kind of failure or penalty.</li><li>Benefits realisation. Research shows that an average 50% of negotiated savings are never realised after a contract is signed. This is because of a lack of monitoring and oversight. Gatekeeper keeps you on track.</li></ul>Gatekeeper is accredited to ISO 27001 and 9001 level for Information Security and Quality Management respectively.

The premise for this is personalized information and possibility of communication.Using Microsoft Azure and Cognitive Services, the platform will personalize information to the individual's intellectual level.AudienceThe primary audience is children and youth with intellectual disabilities and others in need of alternative and supplementary communication.Why Leisure ActivitiesThe platform is used for sharing <b>personalized information</b> about <b>special leisure activities</b>. Organisers reach more people with better information about their offerings, and with peronalized information, the audience can take a more <b>active part in their own lives</b>. Better information to more people lowers the threshold to participation in leisure activities.Examples of personalization are text simplification (easy-to-read text), replacement of text with images, video or symbols, as well as text-to-speech and language translation.Leisure activities are a <b>major area</b> for learning, development and social contact for all, and people with disabilities in particular. Many leisure activities give <b>health benefits</b>.Platform AccessPlatform access is provided via an organiser web portal for information entry, a personalized end-user app for information retrieval, and an API for integration from other vendors.Picture Communication SymbolsThe platform includes Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) provided by <b>Tobii Dynavox</b>, our preferred technology content partner.PersonalizationAccess to app functions and information is individually defined per user.

This is aimed at improving efficiency of sharing data and enabling users to provide proof of the existence, integrity and signature of any document or data.	 	The use of the CertiMint SaaS platform requires a licence issued by SettleMint for a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, sub-licensable, transferable, license to use, copy, store, modify, transmit and display such data and documents uploaded by the user.	 <strong>Overview</strong>	 		It is common practice for businesses and individuals to notarize essential agreements and documents. Land titles, employment agreements, wills and business contracts are often notarized to safeguard them throughout time.

The benefits suite offers Wellbeing/Engagement, Learning &amp; Development, and TPA Services (HSA, FSA, HRA, and COBRA) on a single platform. Traditionally administrators had to work with several niche vendors to meet all these needs. This means that they must be in contact with several different account managers and employees are forced to go to numerous locations to access their benefits. This disjointed system creates a lack of employee engagement because it is too difficult to navigate.

People working alone are vulnerable, and a liability for companies. Legislation mandates the protection of lone workers, but companies struggle to establish procedures that can be easily and consistently followed.SafetyAware easily keeps workers in touch with the right people at the right time – with the right insight to keep them safe. It eliminates manual calls that consume time and produce false alarms. The software as a service platform includes an easy-to-use app, a web-based Control Center, 24/7 live response center monitoring, and optional wearables and devices – to protect anyone in your company, wherever they are.- Two-way communication with emergency response staff - Configurable escalation procedures - Ability for response center to standardize on software to increase response times - “Neighbor-helping-neighbour” feature identifies others in the area who might help, whether or not they work at the same companyPrimarily used to protect those working alone and in high-risk environments, SafetyAware is leveraged by organizations in the energy, utilities, home care, government, field services, transportation and health care industries.Unlike traditional call-in programs where employees call their supervisor to let them know they are safe, SafetyAware uses app-based technology with location awareness to save employee time and take the burden off supervisors. Real Time Response Centers across Canada respond to SafetyAware alerts – such as missed check-ins and SOS alarms – providing a timely and pre-determined response outlined by the client.Working in remote locations with little or no cell coverage? No problem. Clients have the choice to use satellite devices with the same features as the SafetyAware App to keep remote workers in communication with the Real Time Response Center.~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/aware360-4880571.aware360_safetyaware?tab=Overview~aware360-4880571.aware360_safetyaware

[]~['Teams']~['Collaboration', 'Human resources', 'Social']~Microsoft Corporation~1.2.1~3/12/2019~Yammer for Teams~1~5.0 ~Empower engagement and collaboration in your organization through conversations and communities.~Bring the power of Yammer to Microsoft Teams and simplify, optimize, and control your communication workflow. Together, Yammer and Teams create new levels of efficiency to get the right information to the right people at the right time. Move broader Yammer conversations to a limited audience for follow ups, discussions, and alignment. Or team members can participate in a Yammer conversation from Teams before posting to a Yammer group. Ways to use Yammer in Teams include organizational changes, event production, software roll outs, and much more. Organizational ChangesOften there are large organizational changes announced to the company. Some companies create groups around those changes, for example an HR Benefits Group when new benefits packages are announced, or Open Enrollment occurs. A Yammer group for employees’ questions would be a place to post and get answers, or to point people to previously answered questions. These questions and answers are helpful to create additional content for FAQs.Sample Groups: HR Benefits Team, Merger &amp; Acquisitions, Leadership ConnectionEvent Production If an event is hosted LIVE or a YamJam in Yammer, you can use both Teams and Yammer together for the best experience for your audience. Some organizations have Yammer groups for each event while other customers have departmental groups and host multiple events within that group.  While the event is going on, there may be a question or comment that needs further discussion with the event team before its answered, either ON AIR or in Yammer. The team can discuss amongst themselves and get back to the original question quickly with an answer. Using Teams provides a backchannel for the event team to coordinate prior to a response.Sample Groups: Leadership Connection, Innovation YamJam, Sales Quarterly ReviewsSoftware Rollout Projects   When new software rolls out to your organization, change can be hard. Employees have questions about efficiency and productivity. IT Project teams have been successful in creating self-help Yammer communities to support these rollouts and changes. Yet when issues and concerns or product improvement are shared, the IT Project team needs a place to converse and determine what should be shared and posted to the wider community. Having an IT Project Core Team channel creates a place for the group to discuss an upcoming outage or an unplanned issue before alerting employees.Sample Groups: New to Office365, CRM Dynamics UsersMarketing and Sales – using a Yammer #topicCustomer facing teams need to stay in the loop about the competition, and yet they may not know of how marketing or the organization is helping prepare for the competition. When the competition is brought up on the Yammer network, the marketing team can keep a pulse without having to be part of every group or conversation on Yammer. The Marketing Team can have the Yammer Tab in Teams set to follow a specific hashtag, like the competitors name. When the hashtag is used in the Yammer network, the tab is populated to start the conversation in the Team channel. The marketing team can easily follow up with specific tactics, content or additional questions in relation to the competitor.

CloudCare acts as an extra layer on top of the Office 365 admin portal and also connects it to other IT environments, such as the local active directory. The countless extra features within CloudCare can be categorized within 4 major blocks: Employee Management System, Reports, Role Management and Working Hours.1. Employee Management System:Allows the IT-administrator to manage the users in different IT environments using automated processes. Adding, copying, editing or deleting employees can easily be done by means of wizards.2. Reports:The Office 365 admin portal contains very few reporting options. CloudCare expands these options and also brings together data from different IT environments.3. Role Management:CloudCare uses different user roles. For example, you can give a HR employee or a local IT employee limited admin access in a secure environment to manage the users.4. Working Hours:The employees can only send or receive emails on any device within the selected time frame. All the features situated within these 4 blocks facilitate the daily job of an IT-administrator. The automation and simplification of repetitive tasks generates more time for the IT-department to focus on important problems.~None~[]~https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/itcarenv.cloudcare_it-care?tab=Overview~itcarenv.cloudcare_it-care
[]~['Teams']~['Human resources', 'Operations + supply chain', 'Productivity']~Allganize, Inc~1.0.0~10/2/2019~Alli~0~NA~Alli helps business resolve employee's questions automatically by NLU AI~Alli is the easiest tool to deliver rich conversational experiences."Alli helps business automate answering questions from employees and customers by natural language understanding AI. Businesses are having too many documents and getting too many questions from employees and customers. And they are spending too much time for getting an answer from these documents. Alli will resolve this.How Alli is different:You don't need to spend any time for manual data tagging. Just upload your FAQ and documents, such as guidelines, legal documents, contracts and company knowledge documents, in Alli dashboard. All's AI will take care of the rest. Alli's AI will automatically find an answer directly from your FAQ or from your uploaded documents in a sentence level.How it can be possible:Alli is powered by Allganize's Machine Reading Comprehension technology. This is how machine reading comprehension is different from usual keyword search. Let's say you have 100,000 documents and you have one question: "how often should I do onsite exams?" If you put this question in the typical keyword search, you'll probably get around 5,000 documents which contains the word: how, should, or do. You need to check one by one manually. For reading 5,000 documents to check the answer, you will probably need more than an hour.However, if you put the very question in Alli, Allganize's machine reading comprehension API brings the answer in a sentence level such as "12 months is good and it can be extended into 18 months" within a second. So, more than an hour became just a second.What Alli can do:Alli will make you build the multi-turn conversation by using easy-to-use GUI: Chatflow Builder. In Chatflow builder, you can use external data node to integrate with any other 3rd party rest API server or your legacy server. The responses are stored as a variable and can be used in the response to make the personalize conversation.Who are using Alli:Alli has many enterprise customers from US, Japan and South Korea from Insurance, Finance, E-commerce, Energy, Telecommunication industries. Half of Alli customers are using it for the employee assistant and rest of them are for the customer support.This app is used in integration with Alli(https://alli.ai)If you don't have alli account please fill demo request form: https://app.alli.ai/demoIntegration guide: https://blog.allganize.ai/alli-microsoft-teams-integration/This app is not available for independent users, it is an enterprise solution.Purchasing, sign-up and configuration of our app is only possible on enterprise level by IT admins.~Add-in capabilitiesWhen this add-in is used, it<li>Can send data over the Internet</li><li>This add-in can access personal information on the active message, such as phone numbers, postal addresses, or URLs.

Get accurate, reduced-biased and automated candidate reports, for an in-depth and fake-resistant view of every candidate.Features:- Fewer Hiring Steps: The TBI report can be generated directly from a video interview, eliminating the need for your candidates to take an additional personality or online behavioral assessment. Reports are auto-calibrated right after the candidate finishes the video interview with the help of competency mapping, ensuring you get an accurate picture of every candidate in the quickest time possible.- Fake-Resistant Insights: Knowing socially accepted answers help candidates fake MCQ-based psychometric tests, reducing the accuracy of their behavioral analysis. The TBI engine analyses the subtext of a candidate’s video or written responses to the interview questions which cannot be easily faked by candidates. These questions need not directly align with the competency being measured but still do the job.- Auto-Calibrating Capabilities: Tired of static assessment reports? TBI has various competencies embedded in it which enables auto-calibration of reports to suit your specific competency requirements and even specific teams within your organization. Just select your essential and desirable competencies and Talview does the rest! It's easy to see whether a candidate’s behavioral profile matches your organization's DNA or the skills for a specific role.- Stack Ranking Candidates: TBI reports are better than traditional lengthy assessment reports as they rank candidates on the basis of their performance.

With LayUp we take a different approach to learning. In addition to the traditional means, our social approach empowers employees within an organization to share knowledge and grow. Incentivized by points, gamification, rewards and recognitions, along with peer learning elements, we fuel user engagement by enabling organizations to build and run their very own eLearning community.   You can think of us as an eLearning solution on steroids. With employees that are self-motivated and driven towards learning, we largely simplify your L&amp;D process, and help you hit your organizational KPIs.LayUp was built with 5 key-concepts in mind:<ol><li>Change the way you Learn – Learning is not just the execution and completion of online courses. Users should be able to create, manage, and share knowledge via multiple forms (share documents, schedule events, create assessments and collaborate) while being able to access the solution from any device in any location.</li><li>Start two-way Conversations – Learning should be thought of as a peer-network. Rather than running a disconnected organization, users should be able to communicate messages, discuss ideas, encourage feedback, and stimulate conversation within the organization.</li><li>Create Loyalty and Following – Learning should drive a strong organization culture. Through inbuilt tools, organizations should be able to create ambassadors that fully understand the brand and champion loyalty and following.</li><li>Increased Accountability – Learning effectiveness should not be guesswork. Users should be able to monitor time spent on activities to identify gaps and take action faster - armed with real data.</li><li>Enterprise Support – Learning should be a seamless experience. Through inbuilt APIs, information should be exchangeable across enterprise applications to drive efficiency and agility across the organization.</li></ol>What started as a small education startup in 2016, today runs across 4 continents across over 21,000 users with over 1M+ USD in signed agreements. Our aim is not just to create a better online education experience, but to use LayUp to fundamentally transform the way organizations think about and deliver online training across the world.
